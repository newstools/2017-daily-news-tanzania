The Company’s Managing Director Mr Kapila Ariyatilaka said in Iringa that farmers will be educated about the cultivation and preservation of tomatoes. “For farmers to supply their produce to the factory, their produce should meet standards set by the factory,” he said. He added, “We’ll be having an open day to call all farmers into our offices and educate them about best agriculture practices in order to produce high quality products,” He called on the government to consider offering subsidies or tax incentives to increase efficiency in the production. He added there has been a great investment into the construction of the factory and the installation of modern machines and so to cover that cost it will be good to be granted tax exemption. In one month they're expecting to produce 500 tonnes of agricultural products while the main crop will be tomato, which signifies the contribution in promoting agriculture in the country. He said the launching of the factory will increase the employment rate for the youth who reside around the factory and those from Ilula District. The choice of building the production plant was strategically as Ikokot is known for producing the best quality of tomatoes. This plant will benefit the locals such as the local farmers growing tomatoes around the area will now have a reliable and consistent market for their produce.
