They argued that the current 20,000/- grant has been in place for quite a long period and obviously overtaken by events. So, they said, it would be appropriate if the government would consider increasing the rate in order to match with the actual situation. They, however, applauded the government for the 20,000/- they have been receiving because it has helped them enormously in solving various challenges; including the provision of school uniforms to their children and grandchildren, buying food for their families and establishing small entrepreneurship projects. The Tasaf Coordinator for Singida Municipality, Mr Juma Nzogu, urged the beneficiaries to be creative in coming up with small projects that would boost family incomes. He further called upon the community to take advantage of the funds issued by the government, donors and various financial institutions so that the money could make positive changes in their lives. He also asked the community to abandon outdated traditional practices by giving women the chance in owning various assets and other investments, saying that the group has proved to be excellent in finance management. According to Singida Regional Tasaf Coordinator, Mr Patrick Kasango, each beneficiary in the programme is paid a grant of 20,000/- in addition 28,000/- to 72,000/- is also reimbursed as education and health grants accordingly and a further 34,500/- is paid for public works projects.
