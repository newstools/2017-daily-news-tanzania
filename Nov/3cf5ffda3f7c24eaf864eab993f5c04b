Head of the Lutheran Church of East African, Bishop Jesse Angowi, briefing reporters on the church’s imminent three events later this month, said: “Our key responsibility as pastors, apart from serving believers, is to work closely with the government in the country’s building efforts,” he said. Commenting on the three events on November 26, Bishop Angowi, said they will include installation of the new Assistant Bishops of the Church in Tanzania and the installation of the Church’s Secretary General in Tanzania. In another development, Bishop Jonnes Molla of the Furaha Church in Tanzania, has urged religious leaders to refrain from making statements which could destroy the country’s peace. “We, religious leaders, have one great and important goal and that is to preach peace...we therefore should be careful with the remarks we make to avoid getting into the trap of becoming the source of violence in the country,” he said. He added, “Violence and instability affecting other countries including those neighbouring Tanzania, should warn Tanzanians. Let us learn from them to avoid violence.”
