The Deputy Chief of Party ENGINE programme, Mr Scott Benett, said the platform bridges the knowledge gap between business development services providers and micro, small and medium enterprises. “The online platform will also enable micro, small and medium enterprises to better access the information, support and financing they need while services providers and financial institutions will gain access to a large network of potential customers.” He said so far there are 200 registered business owners and business development services providers on the platform. He said ENGINE is a four-year USAID funded activity that increases private sector investment leading to inclusive and broad based economic growth in the SAGCOT regions of Mbeya, Morogoro, Iringa and Zanzibar. He said Bizfundi will foster the growth and capacity of a sustainable market for business development services by ensuring micro, small and medium enterprises can easily access assistance to strengthen their operations. “As part of ENGINE’s financing for growth component we are working to broaden access to finance for small businesses as the online platform will create a link with financial institutions,” he added. ENGINE is currently developing a credit readiness services that will enable micro, small and medium enterprises to access credit for their businesses. As part of the services, registered micro, small and medium enterprises will have their profiles linked directly with a network of financial institutions on the platform.
