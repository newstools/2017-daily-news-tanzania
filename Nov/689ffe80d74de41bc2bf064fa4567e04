Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shahidi convicted the student, who is alleged to be a son of the late Tarime Member of Parliament (Chadema), Chacha Wangwe, of the offence after taking into consideration evidence produced by six prosecution witnesses. The Magistrate, who was hearing the case at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in the city, warned Wangwe junior to refrain from engaging in such kind of crimes, as being a youth he still has a future and was required to set an example of remaining a good citizen in the society. However, the convict expressed his dissatisfaction on both conviction and the sentence imposed on him. He said he would appeal to the High Court, believing that the words he published had no seditious element to warrant him to be prosecuted and that he was exercising his right of freedom of speech. The prosecution, led by Senior State Attorney MwanaAmina Kombakono had told the court that Wangwe junior, a resident of Mwenge Mlalakuwa, committed the offence on March 15, 2016, in Dar es Salaam. On the material day and with intent to mislead the public, Wangwe allegedly published through a social media network, namely Facebook, a publication con taining misleading information relating to political affairs of Zanzibar. Literally meaning, “Tanzania is a country that fills hate (sic) to its citizens…The result of raping democracy in Zanzibar is more dangerous than the Union itself. It is not possible the Zanzibar country to be a colony of Tanzania mainland because of ignorance”.
