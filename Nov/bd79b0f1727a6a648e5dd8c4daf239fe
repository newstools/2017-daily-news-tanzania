The Deputy Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Abdallah Ulega told the Parliament here yesterday that they are mobilising youth and equip them with the needed knowledge so that they can start cultivating the feeder which is in great demand. He called upon youths to tap the opportunity, taking into account the growing demand of feeder now that livestock is one of the key commercial activities that majority of people are engaged in. He assured Parliamentarians that the seeds will be available in all agri-input shops as it is the case with other seeds. He gave the assurance when answering Maria Kangoye (Special SeatsCCM), who wanted to know the number of youths who were mobilised to form or join groups for easy accessibility of loans. Mr Ulega said the launch of the national livestock master plan is to be done soon, saying it will give a clear picture of the actual feeder or hay needs which could be used for farming according to area demand, depending on the number of livestock available. He said a number of awareness campaigns have been conducted in Tanga, Shinyanga, Mwanza, Iringa, Rukwa, Njombe, Manyara, Dodoma, Lindi and Mtwara.
