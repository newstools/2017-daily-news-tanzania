These remarks were made during a telephone interview conducted by the Sunday News with the founding Director of Aga Khan University’s’ Institute for Human Development, Dr Kofi Marfo. “The common saying that Africans believe it takes a village to raise a child is indeed a good way to think of the responsibility we all have towards children’s development, but we need to understand that the village is no longer found in upcountry or the rural home of a child’s family,” Dr Marfo supplemented that each member of the society is responsible for children’s development, saying that it is a collective responsibility to create safe spaces for chil- dren to play, and access to safe drinking water for them to grow in good health. Speaking ahead of the second International Con- ference on Early Childhood Development taking place in Dar es Salaam on November 7-9, he said the foundation for what children will become and how well they will contribute to the larger social good was laid very early in life, adding that the early childhood period was a time of rapid brain development. The conference pro- gramme is centred round the theme ‘Early Childhood Development in Uncertain Times: From Awareness and Evidence to Commitment and Action’. Expounding further, he said there was no healthy child without a healthy family, therefore there must be broad investment when looking for the bright future of children, saying that governments across the world should manage natural resources and create additional value from those resources to invest in the provision of ser- vices and a reasonable quality of life for their people.
