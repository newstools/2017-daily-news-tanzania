The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, Professor Kitila Mkumbo, officiating at the World Vision East Africa Regional WASH Learning event here yesterday, said more efforts are made to ensure all projects are sustainably functional, as the target to reach 95 and 85 per cent of urban and rural populations, respectively, by 2020 remains intact. He said efforts are under way to ensure that defunct projects, which account for about 30 per cent of all 167,000 are revived, with new ones built to safeguard water sources, “Or else, come 2020 Tanzania will have many completed projects with limited access to the precious liquid.” The permanent secretary noted that there are many challenges that face Tanzania and Africa in relation to management and supply of water but hinted that his ministry is determined to develop and sustainably manage water resources in close collaboration with key stakeholders like World Vision. World Vision Tanzania Director of Project Devocatus Kamara said under its long and short-term projects in 13 regions of Tanzania, the organisation has spent 3.4bn/- in a year. Some of activities are include construction of water wells as well as safeguarding water sources on rivers and maintaining water canals. The meeting brought together delegates from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and donor countries--US, Germany and Switzerland--to exchange ideas and share experiences to move forward, positively. World Vision Tanzania National Director Tim Andrews said in 13 regions of Tanzania, World Vision target by 2020 is to contribute towards measurable improvement in sustained wellbeing of boys and girls, especially the most vulnerable.
