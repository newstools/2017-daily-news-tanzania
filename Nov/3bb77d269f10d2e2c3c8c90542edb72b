Dodoma currently has a capacity to produce 61,500 litres of water a day, serving about 500,000 residents in Dodoma Urban, which is equivalent to 80 per cent of the town dwellers, according to Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation, Mr Jumaa Aweso. “The dam at Farkwa therefore will contribute to a large extent into water production and meet the demand of a number of people shifting to Dodoma,” said the Deputy Minister while briefing reporters shortly after visiting water pumping station at Mzakwe yesterday. The demand for water service is set to increase due to the growing number of people, including public ser- vants relocating to Dodoma following the government’s decision to shift to the desig- nated capital city. Briefing the Deputy Min- ister, Dodoma Urban Water Supply and Sewage Authority (DUWASA) Chief Executive Officer, Engineer David Pallangyo, noted that the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the project to build the dam at Farkwa was completed. Engineer Pallangyo said that ESIA was conducted by the Dar es Salaam-based Tres Consult Limited and that feasibility study for the project was conducted by M/S Tractebel Engineering from France. “Assessment of properties and water infrastructure at an area where the dam will be constructed is still ongoing,” observed the DUWASA CEO. Mr Pallangyo further said that DUWASA has reduced water leakage from 40 per cent in 2010 to 29 per cent in 2015, saying that DUWASA was making efforts to ensure the percentage of water leakage continues to decrease. He said frequent power cuts was posing a challenge for operations and water supply in the region, adding that the high operation costs amounting to 485m/- a month was another chal- lenge.
