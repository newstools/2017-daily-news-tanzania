He also directed law enforcement agents to arrest and prosecute parents and guardians who marry off their daughters after dropping out of school after being impregnated. Mr Kakunda stressed that no barriers should be placed along the path of schoolgirlsâ€™ academic dreams, adding that the net of culprits should cover female students whose schooling was terminated over pregnancies and marriage, as well as the men responsible, and parents. He expressed shock over reports that Nkasi District was leading in the region for having the highest number of 152 impregnated school girls (152) in Rukwa Region over the past two years. Criticising some aspects of the legal system, he said it was unfair that a person facing a money laundering charge was denied bail, but someone who impregnates a school girl is granted the favour.
