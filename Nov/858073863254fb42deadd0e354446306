Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the HESLB Executive Director, Mr Abdu-Razaq Badru, cited some of them as multiple admissions, discrepancies in application forms and failure to meet the required criteria. He explained, however, that, as of yesterday, 29,578 first year students had qualified for loans and that 96.5bn/- had already been disbursed to their respective universities. The executive director noted that the money that is required for the first quarter (three months) for the 2017/2018 academic year was 147.06bn/-,which the board had already received from the government. The Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training allocated 427.54bn/- for issuance of loans to 122,623 students of higher learning institutions in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Since Monday this week, hundreds of students who were yet to receive loans had been thronging to HESLB offices to press for loans, insisting that they had all the requisite criteria. Mr Badru told journalists, however, that in their application forms, some students failed to provide important information and documents to prove to the board that they had all the required criteria. “Some claimed that they were orphans but failed to submit approved death certificates of their parents from the Registration, Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA),’’ he revealed. He stated that some students had confirmed their universities after getting multiple admissions, but had switched to others that they perceived as better, while the board had already disbursed their loans to the original institutions.
