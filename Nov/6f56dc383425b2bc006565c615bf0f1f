The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Prof Elisante Ole Gabriel, made the directive to heads of 18 institutions under his ministry in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. “Let’s build a culture of submitting proper data to NBS to fast track our own development, especially at this juncture of industrialisation drive,” said the PS. He cautioned the chief executives to refrain from presenting unverified data at any point in time, reminding them to always have the facts right. The PS said that the only way to overcome unvarying sources of data on one course is to document and hand over the statistics to the proper organ. He, however, directed the institutional heads to prepare a 24/7 managerial response plan which will facilitate communication in the ministry by the end of November. Among other things, he ordered installation of TTCL hotline that will foster communication process wherever and whenever is needed by clients and other individuals. Elaborating on the industrialisation drive, the PS called on Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to carry the agenda forward like all the other agendas they are advocating. “CSOs should work alongside the government to push and encourage industrialisation, tax among other agendas,” emphasized the PS. Prof Ole Gabriel also urged business development officers to know their roles and work accordingly to support the ministry to push the issue forward.
