The tournament is scheduled to tee off from January 13 to 14 next year at the Sea Cliff Resort & Spa Golf Course in Zanzibar. Sea Cliff Golf Administrator, Elias Soka told the ‘Daily News’ from Zanzibar yesterday that the tournament has received good response from golfers so far. Soka said that over 42 men and ladies golfers from different countries have already confirmed their participation at the tournament. “We have received entries from local players, South Africa, Kenya, Zambia, America and Italy so far,” he said. He added that Italy confirmed to bring about 20 golfers at the competition, while other countries share remaining 22 in the current list. Soka added that it was a good response within a short time and he hopes to register more golfers before the deadline, which is pegged on January 8th next year. “We have entries for limited number of 80 golfers at the tournament, over half of the list have already confirmed, it’s better for any golfer wishing to compete in the tournament to register as early as possible,” he said. He said that the 36 holes stable ford format event is eligible for men and ladies amateur golfers only. He said that registration process is still on for those wishing to compete in the event, with USD 50 (about 120,000/-) set as entry fee. “Preparations are going on well, all that remains is for golfers to register, we assure them a wonderful and memorable event,” he said. Soka said that Sea Cliff course that is located near Indian Ocean at Mangapwani was in good shape as officials are also working hard to ensure it remains in good condition ready for the tournament. He also said that the door was still open for sponsors wishing to support the event to come forward. NABAKI AFRIKA LTD became the latest sponsor to hand in the support. Soka named other sponsors as Zanlink, Sea Cliff Resort & Spa Zanzibar, ZMMI Wine & Spirit, Auric Air Services Ltd, Kilindi Hotel, Tulia Unique Beach Resort, Nosy Sports and Acentro Turismo.
