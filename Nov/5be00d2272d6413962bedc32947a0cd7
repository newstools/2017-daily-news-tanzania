He said the government through the Ministry of Health was committed to ending cholera in the islands for good through ongoing interventions mainly awareness and cleanliness of surroundings and improved sanitation. “The ministry cannot stand alone and win the war against cholera. Members of the public, development partners and health officers must work together,” Dr Mohamed said here at a multisectoral workshop on how to deal with cholera. Cholera is an infectious and often fatal bacterial disease of the small intestine, typically contracted from infected water supplies and causing severe vomiting and diarrhoea. It is always linked to filthiness. Zanzibar was hit by a prolonged cholera since September 2015 to October last year in which more than three thousand people were infected resulting into about 60 deaths. The problem prompted tough measures on observing health regulations which included closing down of all street snack cafes, food stalls, improved sanitation, and treatment of water, alongside mass awareness. Dr Mohamed said he was hopeful that with the increased resources from government and partners, strengthened health systems and committed community participation, would lead to the success and make Zanzibar free from cholera. Dr Ghirmay Andermichael from WHO (Zanzibar) reminded Tanzanians about the hygiene including use of toilets, treated water (through boiling), hand washing and keeping the environment clean, as the reliable way to keep away cholera.
