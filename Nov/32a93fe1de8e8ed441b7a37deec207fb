The opening of three branches in Arusha and Kilimanjaro brings the total number of NMB branch network to over 212, more than 800 ATM machines and 4,100 banking agents. Arusha Regional Commissioner Mr Mrisho Gambo commended NMB for the continued efforts to expand its branch network to reach financially marginalized people particularly in the rural areas. “The increased branch network and NMB mobile banking services are doorways for more people to access financial services at the fingerprints,” he said after opening a new NMB branch at Ngaramtoni in Arusha at the weekend. He added, “If I count the number of times for which I went to NMB branch does not exceed five in a year, thanks to the efficient use of the NMB mobile banking,” He said with mobile phone, he can make many transactions and has helped in spending his time wisely. Other branches opened last week are NMB Mbuyuni in Moshi Municipality, and NMB Mto wa Mbu in Monduli District. The three branches will save thousands of customers who were forced to walk long distances to look for banking services. Mr Elibariki Kimario from Moshi Municipality said NMB customer said they used to travel long distances in order to find banking services, like depositing and withdraw particularly after selling livestock and crops at the local markets.
