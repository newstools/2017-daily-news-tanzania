They are Kashindye Bundala, Saidi Ally, Mafunda Ali, Abdulrazak Baus, Mwamba Mungia, Hafidhi Said, Abubakari Nzige, Athumani Ngondo, Endrew Mlugu and Ahmad Mugogo. They all denied the charges before Resident Magistrate Godfrey Mwambapa. The magistrate granted them bail on condition of securing two reliable sureties each. Each surety, according to the magistrate, was required to sign bond of 5m/-. Only Baus, Ngondo, Mlugu and Mugogo managed to meet the bail conditions. The rest were ordered to remain in remand. The case was adjourned to November 29, for mention, as investigations into the matter, according to the prosecution, led by Senior State Attorneys Nassoro Katuga, Pamela Shinyambala and Mwana-Amina Kombakono, were incomplete. It is alleged by the prosecution that between October 1 and November 3, this year, in the city, under the pretext of attending the International Sankuku Judo Tournament and Training Camp, Bundala recruited and transported other accused persons to Millan in Italy for the purposes of forced labour. The prosecution told the court that on October 5, this year, at Mwananyamala area in Kinondoni District, with intent to defraud, Bundala forged a letter purporting that Umoja Judo Club requested participation of the Tanzania Judo team in the 28th Edition Sankuku Judo Tournament, while it was false. It is alleged further that between July 1 and August 15, this year, at the passport control office in Zanzibar, Ali made false declaration for the purpose of obtaining a passport. The court headed further that between October 27 and November 2, this year, at the Embassy of Italy in Tanzania in Ilala District in the city, all accused persons made false declarations for the purposes of obtaining visa to travel to Italy for the tournament.
