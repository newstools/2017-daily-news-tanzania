Ms Mlawi made the call, yesterday, when she visited Tanzania Standard (Newspapers) Limited (TSN), the publishers of Daily News, Sunday News, HabariLeo, HabariLeo Jumapili and SpotiLeo, situated along Mandela Expressway, near Tazara Junction, in Dar es Salaam. The newly appointed PS toured the printing house to familiarize herself with TSN staff, the company’s operations and challenges. Accompanied by the ministry’s Deputy PS, Mr Nicholaus William, Ms Mlawi said some newspapers were surviving in the market because of practising ‘yellow journalism’ and advised TSN management not to embark on such kind of business. “... apart from doing business, government newspapers have the role to deliver accurate and correct information,” the PS added. The TSN Managing Editor, Dr Jim Yonazi, said apart from putting professionalism first, the company has penetrated some East African markets and now eyeing the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through HabariLeo. “We have a good presence online like YouTube, Facebook, blog and website and we are striving to have more subscribers,” Dr Yonazi added. Apart from publishing newspapers, the Managing Editor added that TSN has also embarked on new commercial printing project, which deals with banners, exercise books and also producing documentaries to enable the company generate more revenue. Meanwhile, Director General of the Tanzania Information Services who doubles as TSN board member, Dr Hassan Abbasi said due to the important role TSN is playing, in the absence of subsidies from government, some policies should be revised to build enabling environment to compete with other players in the market. Among TSN’s main objectives are to diversify news products and services to meet established needs of the market and improve the quality and profitability of its products and services.
