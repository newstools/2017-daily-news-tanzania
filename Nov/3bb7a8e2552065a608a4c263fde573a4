Young Africans and Azam have completed the signing of two-year terms of foreign based players. The Jangwani based side concluded the deal with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) center-back Fiston ‘Festo’ Kayembe Kanku, who for a long time was doing trials at the club. Likewise, Azam FC have penned down a two-year deal with Ghanaian striker Bernard Arthur from Ghana’s Liberty Professional Club, who has already arrived in the country ready to start his new professional career with the ice-cream makers side. Also, there are hot speculations that Simba SC are hunting for their new striker, probably from Mali, even though more details are yet to be released by the club. Simba are also said to be hunting Ghanaian defender Asante Kwasi. Yanga defence, which is usually made up of Kelvin Yondani, Andrew Vicent, Juma Abdul, Gadiel Michael as well as Nadir Haroub Ally has so far conceded five league goals from 11 matches. And, the arrival of a new defender means the Jangwani team has ended its romance with the Togolese defender Vincent Bossou, who was highly touted to make a come back at the club. Bossou played a vital role for the club’s title win last season but refused to extend his contract at the club. On the other hand, Azam who announced the termination of the contract with their ex-striker also from Ghana, Yahaya Mohammed few weeks ago, have been struggling at their frontline, a thing which has seen them winning much of their games by a thin victory of not more than two goals. The club management hopes that the new import could bring with him blessed legs. Speaking to media yesterday in Dar es Salaam, Azam FC Media Officer Jafari Idd said their new striker has since joined his fellow players at the club as the management embarks on the process to secure his working permit. The coming in of Arthur will provide a sigh of relief to Azam’s main striker Mbaraka Yusuph, who is yet to get reliable striking power partner.
