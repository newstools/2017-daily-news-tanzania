“Some untrustworthy wananchi especially at border points have a tendency of helping foreigners get things they are not allowed to acquire. So this is just a warning to them,” he said. Foreigners from other East African countries are said to have resettled in border districts of Tarime and Rorya and speak local dialects. The RC was speaking at Mkendo grounds in Musoma municipality during the initiation of the registration and issuance of the ID’s exercise in Mara region. He urged residents aged 18 and above to register and added that it is a criminal offence to aid a non-citizen staying in the country to register in the exercise that is tailored to enable Tanzanians to have national IDs. He said the national ID would help legitimate citizens to be recognised during voting, checkpoints and to be easily identified in the eventuality of accidents. “It would help them most importantly to access social services such as health and education, social protection services such as social cash transfer and banking services.” He added “I swear, if at no legal reason we identify a foreigner in possession of our national ID in his pockets, pretending to be one of us he will face the full wrath of the law.” On his part, the deputy interior minister, Eng Hamad Masauni, said that many foreigners have encroached inside the country illegally. He added that security organs have embarked on an operation to arrest them. He urged residents here, from all walks of life, to provide maximum support to the NIDA commissioners so that the exercise can be conducted in accordance with the time framework schedule. “We are aware that there are many non-citizens residing and conducting own business and working in our country legally, but those who have no proper permission will be flushed out and are forbidden from taking part in the ongoing issuance of IDs,” he said.
