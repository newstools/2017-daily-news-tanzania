Prof Ndulu will be his last appearance on the African Statistics Day before retiring at the end of this year. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Director of Statistics Operations, Mr Irenius Ruyobya, said about 200 participants from ministries, departments, government institutions, development partners, higher learning institutions, secondary school students and statisticians are expected to attend. “Themed ‘Better Lives with better economic statistics,’ this day reminds us of capitalising on correct economic statistics that will help the government to put up policies as well as making assessment of various programmes including the second Five Year Development Plan, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2020 and African Agenda 2063,’’ he said. Each year Africa celebrates this day to raise public awareness of the importance of statistics in all aspects of social and economic life. The theme of the day this year focuses on the critical role economic statistics plays in underpinning economic governance that leads to durable growth and linking economic growth with better lives and better economic status for all citizens of Africa. Above all, all key macroeconomic variables (national accounts, savings and investment, employment interest rates, inflation) and microeconomic (poverty, inequality, social outcome indicators) are based on statistics.
