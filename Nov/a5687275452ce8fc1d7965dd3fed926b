The USAID Deputy Mission Director in Tanzania, Ms Helen Pataki, expressed the sentiments during her site visit to the project’s activities in Kinondoni and Temeke in Dar es Salaam Region, to assess the implementation of USAID-funded activities. “It was very interesting to see Sauti project and beneficiaries work together with the government to reduce HIV/Aids prevalence and help people with their health status. The testimonies from the beneficiaries are so touching and we are happy there is great impact from these interventions,” she said. She thanked the local government for supporting the project and opening their doors for beneficiaries to use their facilities to pick new ideas and skills necessary for their survival. The Sauti Chief of Party, Dr Albert Komba, said the project targeted all vulnerable groups, including young girls who are out of schools, by engaging them in services like biomedical services, that include voluntary HIV testing, family planning, screening for Gender Based Violence. “We are particularly impressed with how our projects are sharing experiences and lessons learnt in terms of engaging beneficiaries to be part of the project through economic activities, which is part of the DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, Safe) initiative. On his part, the Kinondoni Municipal Deputy Mayor, Mr George Manyama, said “…Jhpiego, through the Sauti project, is an example of a real partner who has collaborated with us in fighting HIV/ Aids prevalence with action in our municipality.” To-date, since they started, they have reached 13050 (AGYW) vulnerable individuals in 17 wards out of 19 wards in Kinondoni which makes a total coverage of 90 per cent of the area.
