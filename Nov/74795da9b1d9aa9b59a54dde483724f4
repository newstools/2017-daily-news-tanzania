Speaking at the NMB Executive Network (NEN) event held here over the weekend and attended by various top end and corporate customers, the Bank’s Head of Corporate Banking, Mr Nsolo Mlozi said all the customers conducting international trade should be technologically equipped. According to Mr Mlozi for the time being NMB had no plan to open branches outside the country advising its Corporate and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to venture into modern banking technology to facilitate quick and timely movement of money and goods. “We have heard a request from one of our customers here that we should open a branch in Nairobi. It is a good advice although it was not in our priority list at least for the time being. The business world is rapidly changing into digital and I would rather challenge our customers to adopt the same,” he said. Mr Mlozi was responding to a concern raised by Charles Marwa Warioba who asked for a bank despite its major achievements to invest in a number of other areas including opening branches outside Tanzania particulary in Kenya. With internet and online banking, noted Mr Mlozi, businesses were guaranteed of simplified transactions with reduced manual and paper works hence increasing efficiency. Earlier, the NMB Chief of Wholesale Banking, Mr Richard Makungwa said meeting Corporates and SMEs was an important session held annually for its customers to share with the Bank and improve services. “The today’s business climate is advancing so sharply therefore meeting with you helps us come up with new approaches to the challenges facing our businesses and how best we can serve you,” he said.
