In the same vein, the project will help in the expedition of mediation of land disputes and guarantee that every land owner gets the right to proper information at the required time. The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement Development Permanent Secretary (PS), Ms Dorothy Mwanyika, said this yesterday in Dar es Salaam at the launch of an orientation workshop of the ILMIS for Ubungo, Kinondoni municipality and city council directors. She said that the objective of the project was to have an effective system that enables land owners in the country to further the development of human settlement and a system that will be a database for both economical and community benefits. “The government has signed a contract with a company called IGN FI for the implementation of the project since July 5, 2016 for a period of 24 months and will elapse in June 2018,” Ms Mwanyika said. She said that the implementation of the project will help reduce the time and cost in following up transactions and different information associated with land issues. Ms Mwanyika said that another revolution that the project will bring is the assurance of the safety of different land documents, help in the follow up of land expenses and proper land planning and reducing government returns. “Bigger still, the land sector will increase its contribution to government returns, where in this financial year, the ministry has set a goal of collecting 112bn/-, if every stakeholder fulfils their obligation, this goal will be met,” she said. The PS said that the ILMIS project has the goal of enabling quick land services and to reduce costs to the general population. She explained that the increase in need for information in the land sector coupled with the use of technology brought about the need to have a digitalised database system.
