The Deputy Minister in the Vice President’s Office (Union and Environment), Kangi Lugora announced the suspension of the two officers in two separate incidents after noting shoddy job and poor implementation of the World Environment Fund project which started in 2014. While in Kibiti, Coastal Region, recently to inspect the Mangrove tree planting project, the deputy minister said he noted that most of the funds earmarked for the project were misappropriated and the project was poorly implemented. “I have noted a lot of anomalies in this project and I am ordering the coordinator of the project, Mr Sebastian Kaganija be suspended pending a thorough investigations against the suspect” the visibly irked Deputy Minister said. The Deputy Minister also ordered the District authorities in the areas where the projects were implemented to bring financial report to the Vice President office detailing how the funds were spent. Another public official who faced the deputy minister’s wrath is the coordinator of the mangrove tree planting project in Bagamoyo, Coastal Region. The second official, whose name was not immediately identified, was suspended for his failure to manage the project and the funds provided. According to the deputy minister, the suspended officials contracted people and paid them to plant the trees instead of involving villagers themselves to bring the sense of ownership into the project. He said the project implementation procedures required district authorities to involve village groups to plant trees and administer them to maturity, something that was not done. In 2012, the Global Environmental Fund agreed to fund initiative to sensitize the local community on environmental conservation and mitigate the negative effects of climate change in Pangani Tanga, Zanzibar and Rufiji with commitment of $ 3.3 million. It was envisaged that 1000 hectares of mangrove trees would be planted in fiveyear period.
