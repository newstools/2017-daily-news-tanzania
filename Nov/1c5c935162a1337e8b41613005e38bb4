Speaking to journalists yesterday, the company’s Community Social Responsibility Manager, Andrew Kashangaki said the scholarship for all students will cost 90m/- He added that apart from the sponsorship offered to the five students, the company is currently funding 40 students for secondary education from the island, and the move has helped to boost parents morale of sending their children to school. Kashangaki added that this year his company intended to sponsor 10 students for higher learning studies but only the five students qualified for the scholarship. He named the students who secured the scholarship as Haji Naoda and Mwanaimani Falaki, who will both pursue their Bachelor of Business Administration studies at University of Dodoma, while Fahadi Likwena will join Mzumbe University in Morogoro for a Bachelor degree in procurement. Hussein Ibrahimu will join the National Institute of Transportation (NIT) for a Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance while Samiu Mohamed will attend the Mwalimu Nyerere Memorial University for a Diploma in Community Development. Speaking to the ‘Daily News,’ one of the beneficiaries, Mwanaimani Falaki expressed her gratitude to the company for the support in her studies. She said that she did not expect that one day she will attend higher education, and promised to study hard and return back to support her community.
