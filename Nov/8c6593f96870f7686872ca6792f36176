The remark was made by Deputy Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office-Labour, Youth, Mr Antony Mavunde here yesterday, saying it was the role of every member of the public to maintain the national values. He made the speech while presiding over an event to commemorate and honour St Gaspar Del Bufalo, who was the founder of Missionaries of the Precious Blood, which form a community of priests and brothers within the Roman Catholic Church. The Deputy Minister hailed religious leaders for playing a pivotal role in preaching peace and solidarity to members of the public in the country, adding that the traits are the cornerstone of development in Tanzania. Mr Mavunde said the government is determined to ensure that all members of society live in peace and solidarity, and stressed that peace plays a key role in social and economic development in people’s livelihoods. On his side, Vicar General for Catholic Archdiocese of Dodoma, Rev Chesco Msaga, pointed out the main goal of the Church is to guide people to live in peace and practice love. Rev Msaga said the Catholic Church also helps the people to attain real development by providing them with social services including education and health. The Missionary priests of Precious Blood first arrived in Dodoma, a half century now, and since 1967 to date, they have been engaging in building schools, hospitals amongst other social amenities. They currently run St Gaspar Hotel, the Catholic Radio Station, Mwangaza and Bihawana Junior seminary in Dodoma.
