Customers need comprehensive information about their physical and virtual server environments in order to obtain a true picture of how resources are being used especially when trying to scale and rapidly provision workloads. Cloud computing is changing the way companies do business. Vastly scalable and less resource and energy intensive, it enables organisations to purchase robust and reliable infrastructure and application services at predictable, reduced costs. "In offices today and in corporate data centres, cloud computing is the ‘flavour’ of the day and we have managed to deliver world class cloud services…." said Acting Director for Vodacom Enterprise Business Unit, Boniface Emmanuel. Cloud Computing is a technology where data is outsourced and stored in a secure environment (the cloud) and then provided as a service online, either by subscription or on a pay on demand basis to customers,” A major benefit of cloud computing is the flexible, on-demand model that allows enterprises to rapidly acquire additional computing power only when needed. However, this presents significant security and audit challenges. Today's regulations require a complete audit trail when demonstrating identity and security compliance. The service offers flexibility, allowing users to add, remove, downgrade and/or upgrade resources’ ease of use and ability to start up right away.
