‘Class’ defended the title after winning on points over South African fighter Koos Sipho Sibiya at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam on Saturday night. Mgendela, who won on points awarded by all judges, saw his victory being refuted by his colleague immediately after the match but that was enough to award spectators, who thronged the venue to cheer up their beloved boxer. It was not an easy fight though for the country’s fighter upon considering that he was subjected to a well experienced boxer, who has won many titles to his name. Indications that Mgendela could win the championship were revealed in round 8 when he severely injured his opponent on the nose making it hard for the South African man to come back into the bout. It was in eighth round that Mgendela dominated the fight hence making his dreams of defending the title on home soil come true. Speaking after the fight, Class thanked the government for the support, which made it possible for him to defend his title. “The government has been there to support me since I entered into camp to prepare for this fight. It always feels good to get such back up from top government officials,” he said. On his part, Minister Mwakyembe expressed his happiness following the boxer’s latest feat. He promised the government’s continued support for him to keep excelling at the international stage. “He deserves a pat on his back for a wonderful display, calling on other local boxers to emulate his (Class) performance,” said minister Mwakyembe.
