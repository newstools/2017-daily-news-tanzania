According to a statement issued by the Director of Tanzania Information Services and Chief Government Spokesperson, Dr Hassan Abbasi, yesterday, the swearing-in ceremony will be held next Tuesday. Information from Nairobi that has also been confirmed by Kenya Government Spokesperson, Mr Eric Kiraithe, states that over 20 Heads of State have confirmed their attendance during next week’s swearing-in ceremony. “On Tuesday, next week, we expect a number of high profile guests, preparations are still underway even as we prepare the final list of dignitaries who will grace the event,” Mr Kiraithe was quoted by Kenya media in his briefing on Thursday. According to Kenyan media, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be among the 20 heads of state who will be attending. Quoting the Times of Israel, the media said Mr Netanyahu will fly to Nairobi next week to attend the inauguration. “Mr Netanyahu will be in Kenya for several hours, flying in on Tuesday morning and leaving the country later the same day, after attending the ceremony at Kasarani,” the media reported, yesterday. On Monday, the Supreme Court of Kenya unanimously rejected two petitions to nullify last month’s controversial repeat presidential election results, paving the way for Mr Kenyatta to be sworn-in for a second term. However, Kenya’s worst political crisis in a decade is expected to drag on as Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, has rejected Mr Kenyatta’s victory as ‘illegitimate’ and started a “national resistance movement” to force another election within six months.
