It has in addition stated that 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. “This is in line with the national and global target to ensure three zeros,” said Jenista Mhagama, a minister in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled). She was speaking at the opening ceremony of a capacity building workshop for members of the parliamentary committee on HIV and AIDs, at the parliament’s grounds, also attended by representatives from the UN AIDS. “We are also committed to ensure 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression by 2020. The government has embarked on a number of initiatives, and I believe with support from stakeholders, we will win,” she said. The minister did not, however, outline the cost of financing the plan but said MPs will play a crucial role in facilitating success of government strategies. With 37 million in the world reported to be living with HIV, in Tanzania 5.1 per cent of her 50.9 million people are HIV positive. Ms Mhagama pointed out that women, children and special groups, were still reporting a high rate of new infections countrywide.
