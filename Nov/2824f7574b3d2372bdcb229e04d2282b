He said currently, some people in the country lack better key social services including water, health and education; hence government is undertaking some measures to fulfill the said obligations. Mr Majaliwa gave the explanations during the spontaneous questions session to the Prime Minister in Dodoma, after Temeke MP Abdalah Mtolea asked on when the constitution making process will start. The Premier responded that the country has invested more on collections to enable it to deliver better services; the current constitution will be used.
