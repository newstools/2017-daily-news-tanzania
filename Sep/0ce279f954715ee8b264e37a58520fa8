Speaking at the closing meeting of a three-year training programme of Irish potato production here over the weekend, the Head of Clusters Development with Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzanians (SAGCOT), Ms Maria Ijumba, said the training helped to unleash several opportunities of the crop. We are better placed to lead in producing potatoes in East and South of Saharan Africa. We have everything and the three years of the training saw a great change where farmers triple their production, Ms Ijumba said.She attributed the achievement as a true partnership and commitment shown between the government and the private sector during the whole period of training programme for the farmers. The Dutch Government has also promised to build a Centre for the development of the Potato Industry in Mbeya, Ms Ijumba said, noting that the centre meant a lot for boosting the sector.She said it was an easy task to change the farmers mindset transforming from tradition farming to modern when the training programme was introduced for the first time. It is now evident that Irish round potato crop has of late been poverty liberator to farmers in the Regions of Mbeya, Iringa and Njombe. Before this programme, farmers used traditional methods which had no impacts in their lives, Ms Ijumba said.Earlier, the Njombe Regional Assistant Secretary (Economics and Production), Mr Lameck Noah, thanked SAGCOT and its partners for the training programme in which he described the programme as a panacea for potato farmers. The region will ensure that all the councils work closely with farmers and extension officers continue to team up with farmers in producing high yield seeds, Mr Noah said, calling for farmers to transfer skills and knowledge to other areas.He said the government recognised the efforts and support of SAGCOT Centre and its partners in transforming smallholder farmers in the corridor.One of the farmers who benefited from the training, Ms Leah Nsilu from Matembwe Ward in the region said the programme helped her and colleagues to tilling, planting and manuring farms in the corridor.
