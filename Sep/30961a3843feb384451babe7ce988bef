Addressing members of media yesterday at Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) headquarters in the city, Stars Head Coach Salum Mayanga said Ajib has been recalled following his impressive performance at his new club Yanga. “We are still in the process to select a broad team which will be used for the upcoming AFCON qualification matches to begin in March, next year, hence all these friendly games we play are vital for squad reinforcement,” Mayanga said. Singida United first choice keeper, Peter Manyika, has also earned a recall in the team as a back up for Aishi Manula. Manyika has regained his best since leaving Simba during the last transfer window and has also been a regular choice between the sticks for Hans van der Pluijm. Mayanga has called five foreign based players in his squad including skipper, Mbwana Samatta, who features for Belgium top Division side KRC Genk. The team will move into camp in Dar es Salaam next Sunday. Stars full squad has Goalkeepers: Aishi Manula, Ramadhani Kabwili and Peter Manyika. Defenders: Gadiel Michael, Erasto Nyoni, Boniphas Maganga, Adeyoum Ahmed, Abdi Banda, Kelvin Yondani and Salim Mbonde. Midfielders: Himid Mao, Hamis Abdallah, Muzamiru Yassin and Raphael Daudi. Wingers: Simon Msuva, Shiza Kichuya, Morel Ergenes, Abdul Hasan and Ibrahim Ajib. Strikers: Mbwana Samatta and Mbaraka Yusuph.
