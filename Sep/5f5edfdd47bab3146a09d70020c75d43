The money was accrued following an operation carried out by the police from September 6 to 14. Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander Lazaro Mambosasa (pictured) said the police also inspected vehicles, motorcycles and auto-rickshaws to determine whether they were road worthy. We conducted the operation not because we wanted to collect the money but because we wanted to make sure that road users comply with traffic rules, Commander Mambosasa said.Offences committed by the fined road users include drunk while driving, failure to obey orders and putrefaction of vehicles. I appeal to drivers and other road users to comply with road safety rules to avoid accidents.Drivers should be careful to avoid loss of human lives, the police chief said. He warned drivers and other road users that police will sustain the crackdown to ensure the safety of human lives and property.According to Mambosasa, 99 motorcycle riders were taken to court for violating road safety regulations.The riders were arrested after they were found carrying more than one passenger in a manner known as mishikaki . Some of them were caught for not wearing helmets.
