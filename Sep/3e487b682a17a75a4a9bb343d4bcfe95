The six convicts were charged with chopping the left hand of 12-year old Mwigulu Matonange, and running away with it before some were later caught red handed scouting for a prospective buyer.The case judgment attracted hundreds of Sumbawanga Town residents, with Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC) Zelothe Steven among them.The RC was in the courtroom to hear the judgment from the beginning to the end. The court also set free four accused for lack of sufficient evidences. Delivering the ruling, the trial Judge, Dr Adam Mambi, said the six accused were found guilty of the two counts of conspiring to murder and attempting to kill the minor albino.The convicts were Weda Mashilimu Baba Siha, Ignas Sungura, James Paschal, Nickson Ngalimia, Ibrahim Tela and Faraja Jailos Mwezi mpya. The four freed suspects were Kulwa Mashilimu, Peter Said Simon Msalaba, Hamis Rashid and James Ngalamio.Justice Mambi said, For the first count of conspiring to murder, the six convicts will serve 14 years in jail and for the second count of attempting to kill, the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.But, after taking into consideration several issues, including mitigations of the accused, type of the crime and the fact that all the six had no previous crime records, each of them will serve 20 years in jail as the sentence goes concurrently. It was initially claimed before the court that the accused committed the crime on February 15, 2013 at Msia village along Lake Rukwa Basin in Sumbawanga district. Prosecuting, State Attorney Fadhili Mwandolo summoned 12 witnesses to substantiate the case, with the victim s mother being one of the witnesses.The victim currently lives in United States of America.
