Ndairagije, whose team played all three games in away venues, said their first home game will be historic as he hopes to stain Simba s clean-sheet as well as the unbeaten run.He said last season Simba were lucky to survive his team s 2-0 lead scare and end 3-2 victors, but it won t be the same this year. Commenting more about his team preparation, Ndairagije said his team is well prepared tactically and psychologically for the match.The Burundian tactician said his team has been improving daily despite losing two matches. My team is improving and we have managed to score a goal in all our matches we have played so far. We are having a new team but now I am working very hard for our players to get enough experience, he said.Speaking about his team s two consecutive defeats, Ndairagije said his team played good football in their 2-1 defeat against Mtibwa Sugar and Singida United. But the coach admits the league is very tough and highly competitive as all teams are well prepared.He called upon the team s supporters in Mwanza to unite and rally behind their team in tomorrow s matches and all others until the end of the season.
