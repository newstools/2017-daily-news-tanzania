Nyankumbu Girls High Secondary School student, Ms Janeth Joseph, said that the school has made her dreams come true and completely changed her life. “Nyankumbu Girls High School has an advanced library, best classrooms and dormitories, well equipped laboratories, sports facilities and other amenities including abundancy of accommodation space for teaching and non-teaching staff,” she said. “Thanks God that GGM through its investment at Nyankumbu Girls Secondary helped me to pass my examination with flying colours,” said 20 year old Janeth who passed by division two in her Advanced Certificate of Secondary School in 2016. The Headmistress of Nyankumbu Girls Secondary School, Ms Georgia Mgashe, hinted that previously performance for female students was very poor in Geita area, but things have started to improve after GGML’s intervention to build the school. Opening a modern Library at Nyankumbu Secondary School recently, Geita District Commissioner (DC), Herman Kapufi, maintained that authorities in Geita will continue working together with GGML to support all community projects. GGM Vice-President for Sustainability, Mr Simon Shayo, said GGM would continue to support all social projects with long lasting positive impact to communities..
