The League has been a goal dry for other teams despite Emmanuel Okwi’s huge lead in the race for the golden boot, something that promises Simba a glorious season. On top of the league command, however, are Mtibwa Sugar who have enjoyed the helm right until the third round, though Simba’s colourful going has been much headlined. Apart from the big spenders Simba, Azam and the struggling defending champions, Young Africans, there was an impressive going for the league debutants; Lipuli and Singida United, while disastrous debut for Njombe Mji, who are pointless and winless after playing three matches. From what we have witnessed in the previous rounds, this year’s league promises to be highly competitive arguably due to the presence of many professionals recruited from all over the continent. From what we have seen and widely reported, we expect even this weekend’s kick-off to continue producing spectacular goals and other actions depicting teams’ superiority in skills and management. We would like to advise all players, especially locals, to work hard for their teams as their efforts help them win. But as well, we would like to insist to the local players to learn from the foreign imports they play together in their teams and see what make them quality players. Having Okwi at the helm of the golden boots race with six goals as opposed to two goals netted by the top local player, urges the local players to increase efforts. Likewise, it should be noted that not only the marksmanship that markets a player, defending and midfield skills also are very crucial since all sections of football depend on each other. As we conclude by wishing the teams a colourful kickoff, we would again call on local players to work hard as individuals while strictly observing team-work discipline in their hard fight for good results.
