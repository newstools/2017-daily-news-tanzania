Some seven hundred refugees from Burundi who have volunteered to return home are expected to depart this week, the second such home going after the first batch which left Tanzania on September 7, 2017.According to an Assistant Director in the department of refugees in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Deusdedit Masusu, two batches of 350 refugees each --out of 13,000 who have since registered to return home--will depart tomorrow (12 September) and Thursday (14 September) this week.During this month (of September) we ve scheduled seven repatriation trips each with an average of 350 refugees: on the 7th, 12th, 14th, 19th, 21st, 26th and 28th, says Mr Masusu, adding that more refugees were expected to join the forthcoming trips.Some 13,000 refugees have registered to return home by this September 7, and the ministry expects that more would volunteer following a smooth start of repatriations. By the end of September, we are certain that those who are now hesitating to register will do so because they will find it necessary to go back home after receiving positive feedback from returnees, he noted.He added that all parties were now out to ensure, the repatriations were conducted in line with procedures set out in the tripartite agreements to ensure safety and dignity to the returning refugees.What our governments (Tanzania and Burundi) and our partners want, is to do it properly as a way to help these refugees go home and settle ... that will serve as an incentive for others to come forward and register, Mr Masusu added.The voluntary repatriation takes place a few weeks after President John Magufuli asked the immigrants to go back home following reports that the situation in Burundi had currently stabilized.The plea followed information by his Burundian counterpart, Mr Pierre Nkurunziza, that the East African nation is now enjoying peace. He advised the immigrants to return to Burundi and participate in nation building.We have been encouraging these refugees to voluntarily register for repatriation as the situation back home has come back to normal, Home Affairs Minister Mwigulu Nchemba, who toured the refugees camps said.The minister was drumming up President Magufuli s plea to those refugees to go back home. Most of the refugees who have registered for repatriation would like to see the exercise taking place as soon as possible so they can be there during the farming season.Some people flee their countries not because of war or conflicts but just because they need different places from their homes. I urge Burundians to remain in their country. I have been assured, the place is now calm, said Dr Magufuli, noting that the voluntary return by refugees who had been hosted in the country is testimony of the inviting environment back home.The Kigoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Brigadier General (rtd) Emmanuel Maganga told the Daily News in an interview that about 12,000 Burundi refugees were listed to go home by December 31, this year.The first batch of 301 refugees at Nduta camp went home last week with 500 others listed to go home this week. This is good news. We have been assured that the peace and stability of that country have returned to normal, he remarked.The Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC) Major Gen (rtd) Salum Kijuu, was also happy as the Burundians left for home, calling on residents in the region to be vigilant. Residents in the Kagera Region have a duty to ensure that the borders are intact.You must ensure that no foreigners are allowed to enter the country as this posed a security risk. He remarked that there were reports that some foreigners especially in Kyerwa and Misenyi districts had been allowed to own large portions of land, resulting into conflicts and fighting between investors and wananchi.Over 400,000 Burundi refugees were sheltered in three camps in Kigoma region namely-Nduta (Kibondo), Mtendeli (Kakonko) and Nyarugusu (Kasulu). Burundi s Minister for Interior and Patriotic Education, Pascal Barandagiye, extended gratitude to the government and people of Tanzania for the hospitality they accorded to refugees from his country.Every time when there is a problem in Burundi, our people run to Tanzania because they know they will be safe, this shows the close friendship between the two countries, he stated. The Burundian minister urged the immigrants to return back home, noting that all conditions to receive them were in place.It is high time they returned home now that the farming season is about to start, we welcome them back home to develop our country, Mr Barandagiye assured his fellow citizens.The Ministry of Public Security reported that the security situation was generally good throughout the country. Pierre Nkurikiye, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Security said that Burundi is now calm and safe adding that nationals who fled the country are now free to return and work together to develop the economy.The government has made efforts to restore peace and deal with development now. We want the refugees to return home to contribute to the country s development, Burundian President Pierre Nkurunziza called on his fellow nationals living as refugees in Tanzania to return home and rebuild their country.The Burundian leader was in Tanzania on July 20, this year for his first foreign trip in more than two years, seeking to revive political dialogue on the crisis in his country. Speaking in Kiswahili, Nkurunziza also welcomed Tanzanian businesspeople to Bujumbura. We ask Tanzanians to come and establish business in Burundi, he said. He however suggested that the return will be voluntary for whoever wants to heed the call, adding that refugees have to be alerted on the current peace before they are convinced to return home.As testimony to the existing peace and stability in Burundi, the Tanzania Trade Development Authority (TANTRADE) in partnership with Tanzania Embassy in Burundi and Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), have jointly organized a forum and trade exhibition aimed at exploiting the available business and investment opportunities in Burundi.TANTRADE Acting Director General, Edwin Rutageruka revealed that the prevailing peace and stability in Burundi have compelled the authority to go with businessmen and stage an exhibition to promote Tanzania s manufactured products between September 27 and October 1, this year.We have teamed up with our colleagues at our embassy in Burundi and TPA. Burundi is a potential market for Tanzania s products. We have all the reasons to organize our businessmen on the need to fully exploit trade and investment opportunities, he said.According to Mr Rutageruka, the business study conducted by TPA recently and later confirmed by Tanzania s Ambassador to Burundi, Rajab Gamaha showed that the peace and stability of that country have returned to normal and is now suitable for investment flow.We will start having a business forum in Bujumbura and later trade exhibition at the Tempete Grounds, noting that Tanzanian businessmen must get prepared for the splendid business and trade exhibitions.Dr Magufuli reassured Burundi of continued friendship and support to speed up development for the mutual benefits of all citizens of the two neighboring countries. Relations between Tanzania and Burundi have existed for many decades.Tanzanians and Burundians are brothers and sisters. My appeal is for people from both countries to transact business deals in a modern way, Dr Magufuli said hinting that trade volume between the two countries stood at 117 billion US dollars at the end of last year.However, he described the trade volume as negligible, arguing that increased trade is inevitable to hasten development. He directed Tanzanian Ministers to regularly meet their Burundi counterparts to resume trade negotiations that were discarded in 2013.
