Minolacs Executive Director, Munir Bashir said in an appreciation letter to Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) Director General, Deusdedit Kakoko that they were particularly satisfied on the way the Dar port handled its 12,000 tonnes of wheat consignment recently. "We thank the TPA management and staff very much for your very good performance when you handled our cargo brought by MV Loving. We thank you very much and we promise to increase wheat consignment passing through the Dar port to 16,000 tonnes in the first week of October," the letter reads in part. Minolacs is a private flour milling company in Burundi. It imports wheat from Australia, the United States and Canada, and generates an estimated 6.0 million US dollars in annual revenue. Dar es Salaam port which is currently undergoing major upgrading work under support of development partners, has significantly improved in operational efficiency and safety which has resulted into increased flow of customers, especially those from neighbouring landlocked countries. It is currently vying with the port of Mombasa in Kenya to become the trade hub for landlocked neighbours such as Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Burundi, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. TPA has opened a liaison office in Burundi capital city, Bujumbura to bring its services closer to Burundi business community thus easing the plight of Burundian importers and exporters who had to travel to Dar es Salaam port to clear their shipments. TPA has also opened offices in Zambia capital city Lusaka; Kampala in Uganda, Kigali in Rwanda and Lubumbashi in the DR Congo for similar reasons which have helped to cut the cost of doing business, and reduce the hurdles within the logistics and supply chain.
