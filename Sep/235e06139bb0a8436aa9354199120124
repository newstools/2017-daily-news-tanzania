This, according to the Bagamoyo Institute of Arts and Culture (TaSUBa) CEO, Dr Herbert Makoye, is partly due to the improvement made in lighting and sound for all stage performances. “For the first time in the 36 years of this festival we have full professional lighting and sound. This has brought much improvement in the quality of sound and lighting for all the artists, performing on stage within the main theatre. This was made available, he says through assistance provided by sponsors. However, there’s still need for more assistance, he maintains. Although he admits there is improvement in stage presentations, he told the ‘Daily News’ the bulk of the artists are still coming from Bagamoyo or neighbouring Dar es Salaam. “What is missing is getting artists from other parts of the country. Our artists don’t have money to cover their expenses coming and staying here for the eight-day event. On-the-otherhand, our budget does not enable us to provide them with this service. So, we’re looking for sponsors who would bring us good artists from other parts of the country and maybe even abroad,” he explained. Apart from this, he is pleased with the way this year’s episode has been going. For the past five days, they have had a full house of 1,500 persons in the theatre every evening. Another factor which he mentioned as being contributory to this is the high level of professionalism in the groups that have performed. Makoye, also reminded the ‘Daily News’ that they, the organisers, also recognise other activities, such as workshops and the visual arts and crafts exhibition, as important contributors to this year’s successes. Added to this are those people who use the festival, as a place to meet friends or business partners. Providing the space, he says, is also an important function of the festival.
