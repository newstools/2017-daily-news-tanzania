Police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner of Police, Barnabas Mwakalukwa, told reporters yesterday that many victims of communication-related offences were not reporting to law enforcers seeking redress. We advise victims of cybercrime to report to the police and not go to media houses or any other organisation.Any incident related to cybercrimes must be reported to the police because this is a criminal offence. Policemen are the authorities mandated to deal with criminal offences and not any other organisation, Mwakalukwa said.He said the police force has teamed up with TCRA to educate the public on incidents of cyber offences.Cybercrimes have decreased this year compared to last year due to police efforts in collaboration with responsible authorities.TCRA Acting Director of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Development Connie Francis urged social media users to adhere to rules and regulations when communicating with others through their phones. The public should obey rules and regulations of communication. We have been working closely with the police in ensuring offenders are arrested and legal action taken against them once discovered, she said. The role of TCRA is to regulate the industry while the police force is the only authority mandated to carry out investigations and prosecution.
