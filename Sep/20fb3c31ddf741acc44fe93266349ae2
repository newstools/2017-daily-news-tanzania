The Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Prof Makame Mbarawa said yesterday that the road links many areas to the business network and that the government expects to see wananchi utilizing it properly to boost economic activities and building up the economy. “This road must boost business activities in the surrounding areas, I would like to ask wananchi to utilise it effectively,” he said during the inauguration of KIA-Mirerani road by President John Magufuli. He said the first ever 26-kilometre tarmac road in Simanjiro District has cost 32bn/-. “The project has been implemented by the China Henan International Corporation Group Limited (Chico) and it has been funded by the government of Tanzania,” said Prof Mbarawa. According to Prof Mbarawa, the road will help to open up markets in Simanjiro, Arusha, Moshi and other towns. “With reliable infrastructure, it is obvious markets for various products will be open, this will boost our economy since everyone will be able to move and do profitable business without problem,” said Prof Mbarawa. Upgrading of the busy road was one of the promises made by the government way back some years ago. The road is expected to boost the economy of the area, especially tanzanite mining at Mirerani which has led to the flourishing of other economic activities in the semi-arid area and ease transportation between Mirerani and Arusha and Moshi.
