Kinnah, during the week, confirmed to have reported Mbeya City to world football governing body, Fifa, accusing the club of terminating his contract before they pay his dues and for releasing him from his three-year contract, which has 18 months remaining. “As you are aware, the team was failing to pay me. They owe me five months’ salary, so we reached a mutual agreement to terminate the contract. So, because it was the team that was in the wrong, they were also supposed to pay me for three months,” Kinnah said. “I have reported the team to Fifa because football related issues cannot be taken to an ordinary court. The team is at fault because officials don’t want to go by what we agreed. If they had sorted out everything as we agreed, we could not have reached this extent.” Last week, Kinnah said the two parties parted ways amicably on the understanding that Mbeya would only effect the actual termination of his contract in November upon payment of the money. Mbeya City Information Officer, Shah Mjanja yesterday reserved his comment on Kinnah’s action. “We have accumulated our energy towards our next game on Sunday (today) against Stand United in Shinyanga. I am here also. When I get back to the office next week, I shall have learned the issue to do with Phiri. Our current position is that we agreed with Phiri to end his contract,” Mjaja said. The former Flames mentor and Mbeya City parted ways a fortnight but the two parties differed on the reasons. The Malawian claimed that it was due to financial problems whereas the club insisted that the coach had failed to deliver in the 2016 season after finishing on position 11. Kinnah saved Mbeya City from relegation in his first season in 2015. Mbeya City is home to Malawian goalkeeper Owen Chaima and defender Sankhani Mkandawire. Fifa might intervene to ensure that Mbeya City pay up the Malawian.
