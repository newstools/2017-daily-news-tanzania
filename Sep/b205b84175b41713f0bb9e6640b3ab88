What the prosecution is doing is totally improper this amounts to punishment on our part and it s aimed at undermining justice. We pray to the court to intervene so that this matter comes to the conclusion, he submitted.He argued that prior to their first arraignment, they were reporting to the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) for investigations into the matter. On March 14, 2016, he narrated, they were taken to court to face the charges with a certificate to deny them bail. Since then, the prosecution position has not changed they re using this court to punish us technically as we stand today we are being punished, he claimed.Before adjourning the trial to September 18, the magistrate said, This is a message and strong message to the prosecution. I give you seven days to come up with clear position on how to proceed with this case. I will have to be more aggressive on that day.
