Projections of the bank, which is currently raising additional capital through a 10.5bn/- secondary offering, showed the profit will grow in a descending order. According to the bank secondary offering prospectus, next year the bank profit expected to jump up 110 per cent to 995m/- from 473m/- of this year. Similarly, in 2019 the profit will increase by 87.7 per cent to 1.86bn/- to be followed by an increase of 31.7 per cent to 2.46bn/- in 2020 and 30.3 per cent to 3.2bn/- in 2021. Maendeleo Bank Managing Director, Ibrahim Mwangalaba, said the projections based on their three years operation experience. “Over the last three years of operation, Maendeleo has emerged to be a rapidly-growing bank in Tanzania,” Mr Mwangalaba said in prospectus speech. The bank, based on last year data, has over 15,000 customers with deposits of 32.54bn/- and total assets of 41.6bn/-. Also, the profitability trajectories are backed up by net income revenues that projected to increase by roughly 625m/- yearly in the next four years. This year net income estimated to rake in 4.38bn/- and jumped to 5.0bn/- next year before reaching 6.5bn/- in 2019. The revenue then climbed to 7.8bn/- in 2020 and 9.36bn/- in 2021. The bank assumption was that by end of next month its deposit mobilisation campaign will rake in 5.0bn/- in a way of deposits. The campaign started in the first half. The bank ambition plan would work out if managed to raise the anticipated capital through secondary offering that ends 3rd of November. The offer has a green shoe of 50 per cent, to enable the bank to mobilise 15bn/- in total. The shares under offer are 17.6 million sold at 600/- per stock to all investors. “We are sure of realising hundred per cent of the offer subscription,” Mr Mwangalaba said backed by initial public offer that was oversubscribed by 40 per cent in 2013. The bank in 2016 was recognized as the best listed bank under Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) alternative market—Enterprises Growth Market (EGM). The secondary offering will enable the bank to accomplish two milestones—graduating from EGM to the main market and from regional bank status to full-fledged bank.
