The cases saw 13 people condemned to 482 years behind bars over conspiracy to murder and attempted murder of three albino people. In the same vein, the same court set free nine people for lack of sufficient evidence.The Court s Deputy Registrar, Mr Romuli Mbuya told the Sunday News that the said criminal cases were heard on August 31 and September 1, this year uninterruptedly, thanks to the financial assistance from World Bank.Expounding, Mr Mbuya said that the financial assistance geared to facilitate High Courts in the country to implement its 2015/19 and 2019/20 strategic plan to hasten hearing of criminal cases.Equally, he said the same financial assistance from World Bank helped the High Court in Sumbawanga to deliver three judgments for the first time on two consecutive days.The case judgment attracted hundreds of Sumbawanga residents, with Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC) Zelothe Steven among them. On that day, August 31, this year, the court condemned six people each to 20 years behind bar over conspiracy to murder and attempt to kill an albino.The six convicts were charged with chopping the left hand of a 12-year old Mwigulu Matonange and running away with it before some were later caught red-handed scouting for a prospective buyer.The court also set free four accused for lack of sufficient evidence. Delivering the ruling, the trial Judge, Dr Adam Mambi, said the six accused were found guilty of two counts of conspiring to murder and attempting to kill the minor.It was initially claimed before the court that the accused committed the crime on February 15, 2013 at Msia Village along Lake Rukwa Basin in Sumbawanga District.On the same day in late afternoon, in the same court, three people got life imprisonment before the court reduced their prison terms to 20 years behind bars over conspiracy to murder, attempted murder of an albino woman. Equally, the same court set free the fourth accused, Frank Bernard for lack of sufficient evidence.The trio was charged with chopping off the right hand of Ms Maria Chambanenge from Miangalua Village in Sumbawanga District, Rukwa Region and were caught later trying to solicit for buyers.Delivering the ruling, trial Judge Dr Adam Mambi said the three accused were found guilty of the three counts of conspiring to murder, attempting to kill and maiming the albino woman. But, the judge has a mandate to reduce the prison terms after considering several factors, including mitigation of the accused, type of the crime and the fact that the accused had no previous crime records, each of them will serve 20 years in jail.It was initially claimed before the court that the accused committed the crime on February 15, 2013 at Miangalua Village in Sumbawanga District in the region.The following day on September 1, the same court pronounced separate 18-year jail verdicts on three people, after finding them guilty of conspiracy to murder and attempted murder.Delivering the ruling, the trial Judge-in- Charge, Mr John Mgeta, said the three accused were found guilty of three accounts of maiming, conspiring to murder and attempting to kill an albino, Baraka Cosmas.The prosecution alleged that on April 26, 2015, at Malonji area in Mbozi District, Songwe Region, Sajenti was caught with Baraka s right hand, which he had wrapped in a bag and hung on a branch of a mango tree.It was further alleged that upon seeing his husband under police arrest and learning of the circumstances under which he had been arrested, the wife collapsed.
