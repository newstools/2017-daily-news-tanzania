Equally the same court set free the fourth accused, Frank Bernard for lack of sufficient evidence adduced into court by the prosecution side. The trios was charged with chopping off the right hand of Ms Maria Chambanenge from Miangalua village in Sumbawanga District, Rukwa region and were caught later trying to solicit for buyers.The judgment on the much awaited case attracted hundreds of Sumbawanga residents. Delivering the ruling, trial Judge Dr Adam Mambi said the three accused were found guilty of the three counts of conspiring to murder, attempting to kill and maiming the albino woman.The convicts were mentioned as Maiko Kazanda, Linus Siluka and Ntogwa Cosmas alias Sharif wa Kuvyalo. Justice Mambi said, For the first count of conspiring to murder, the six convicts will serve 14 years in jail, and for the second and third counts of attempting to kill and maiming, the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.But, the judge has a mandate to reduce the prison terms after considering several factors, including mitigations of the accused, type of the crime and the fact that the trio accused had no previous crime records, each of them will serve 20 years in jail as the sentence goes concurrently. On mitigation, the trios prayed for lenient punishment because they are remorseful and because they were first offenders and have already been in custody for four years and three months since the case began.The accused also told the court that they have dependents, including parents, children and wives, as one of them told the court he had more than 30 children and several wives who are depending entirely on him.It was initially claimed before the court that the accused committed the crime on February 15, 2013 at Miangalua village in Sumbawanga district in the region. The Prosecution side was led by Ms Lugongo Scholastika assisted by Safi Amani, while the defence had three advocates Peter Kanyalile, Mathias Budodi and Baltazar Chambi.
