However, it was Emanuel Mwendo from Tanzania Prisons who emerged match’s top scorer after notching 22 points. Organised by Dar es Salaam Basketball Association (BD), the six- team event that pooled teams into Groups A and B, is scheduled to wind up on Saturday at the National Indoor Stadium. On-form Savio began the onslaught with 69-63 win over Pazi in their first Group at the same venue. Brian Muramba posted 20 points for winners Savio, but Pazi’s Martin Kalikoli responded with 22 points, but was not enough to rescue his team.
