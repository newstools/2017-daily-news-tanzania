The Deputy Minister who visited the Tanzania Standard (Newspapers) Limited headquarters situated at Tazara along Nelson Mandela Expressway in Dar es Salaam said ‘wananchi’ want to hear and read news on various development issues. She said some of the media houses have been publishing and airing information that aim at tarnishing the government image. She said such kind of news create tension and may lead to the breach of peace among Tanzanians. “We are not going to tolerate such kind of people, newspapers, TV or Radio stations that spread information, which lead to hatred and violence” she said. According to Ms Shonza, Tanzanians want to hear what the government is doing in the war against illicit drugs, tax evaders and other information of such nature. She added: “People want to know and understand what the government is doing, it is our responsibilities to ensure all Tanzanians get such information, we must tell them the truth,” The Deputy Minister, however, pledged her support to media practitioners and media industry at large saying her office is open for discussion on various issues related to challenges facing the profession. Ms Shonza expressed her gratitude on the way TSN operates. “I am glad TSN is recording good performance, I would like to encourage you to continue doing a good job,” she said. Earlier, the TSN Manging Editor, Dr Jim Yonazi told the Deputy Minister that the company is doing everything in its capacity to reach the public by using various methods. He said apart from publishing newspapers, the company is also doing consultations on media related matters, commercial printing, video documentaries and coordinating business forums in various regions across the country.
