TSN was named the Best Print Media of the Year for reporting financial news during the DSE Members’ Awards ceremony in Dar es Salaam on Friday evening, beating other newspapers also gunning for honours. The ceremony, graced by the Deputy Permanent Secretary (DPS) in the Treasury, Doroth Mwanyika, saw Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) being named the best digital media after excelling in financial news reporting. The TSN Managing Editor, Dr Jim Yonazi, received the award from the guest of honour and said it was indeed an honour for the company to be crowned with the top award. “We are honoured to be crowned the Best Print Media in financial news reporting. However, we need to work hard and improve in our work so that we win again next year,” he said. He, however, said that the challenge will be to improve financial news reporting and analysis so that TSN wins again in the forthcoming competitions. Members Awards is an initiative by DSE to recognise and award its members for good corporate governance, investor protection, sustainable growth of their businesses, engagement with investors and the public as well as good fundamental performance and corporate social responsibilities. NMB Bank won the best listed company (Financial Sector) in the Main Investment Market.
