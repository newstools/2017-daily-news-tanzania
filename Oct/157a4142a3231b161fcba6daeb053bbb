Before Kisutu Resident Magistrateâ€™s Court in Dar es Salaam, the accused faced two counts related to accumulation of 500m/- wealth against her lawful earning. The prosecution alleged that the accused inappropriately owns properties, including 19 motor vehicles and maintains a life style beyond her income. Before Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi, the TRA employee denied the charges and was released on bail, with one surety signing a 20m/- bond. The case was adjourned to November 7, when it comes for preliminary hearing, as investigations into the matter are complete. Prosecuting, Principal State Attorney Vitalis Peter told the court that the accused committed the offence on diverse dates between March 21 and June 30, 2016 within the city. Being a public servant, Jennifer was found in ownership of 19 motor vehicles whose value is disproportionate with her lawful income.

Meanwhile, four Zanzibaris appeared before the same court yesterday, accused of unlawfully transporting and possessing four pieces of elephant tusks, the government trophies, valued at 33m/-. Selemani Msomi, Filo Bakari, Kizito Mboje and Rashid Ally were not allowed to respond to the charges after their arraignment before Principal Resident Magistrate Respecious Mwijage because their charges fall under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act.
