A statement issued yesterday by the Registrar of Non Government Organisations (NGO) stated that the suspension became effective yesterday. “The office of the Registrar has suspended CHESA activities in order to pave way for investigations on allegations that it is involved in sensitization of homo sexual activities in various parts of the country. The aforementioned institution, apart from other allegations, is alleged to have coordinated a workshop on homo sexual marriages held on October 17, 2017 at Peacock hotel in Dar es Salaam” reads part of the statement. The Registrar has therefore directed the administration of CHESA to suspend all its activities, including closing all its offices until completion of the investigations. “It should be noted that homo sexual marriages are not allowed since they are contrary to customs, traditions and laws of the country” added the statement. On Tuesday, Dar es Salaam Zonal Police Commander, Lazaro Mambosasa told reporters that they had arrested 12 people who were promoting homosexuality. “We arrested the criminals at (the hotel) Peacock - they were promoting homosexuality. Two are South Africans, one Ugandan and nine Tanzanians” he said. Commander Mambosasa added that they had also arrested the manager of the hotel for allowing them to conduct such unlawful meeting.
