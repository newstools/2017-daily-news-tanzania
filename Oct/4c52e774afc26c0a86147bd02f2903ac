The coach believes sharpening skills in the team is the only way to regain winning ways. The coach said after their weekend 2-1 loss to Simba has forced them to wake up from a slumber. However, the former Toto Africans coach said their major problem is having a big number of inexperienced players who fail to cope with highly experienced local and foreign players. ‘’Most of the players in the team lack exposure of the league because most of them came from the First and Second divisions teams. I am confidence, as the league continues, they will gain experience and deliver,’’ Bilal said. He further said the team will put much efforts to get good results in their next match against Tanzania Prisons at Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya. Commenting on the preparations against Tanzania Prisons match, Bilal said all players were fit for the match and there is no injury. Placed second from bottom, the Shinyanga-based Stand United have lost four games against Singida united, Lipuli and Mtibwa Sugar and Simba. They have won once against Mbeya City in Shinyanga at the end of the fifth round. They have netted three goals and conceded six. Their next opponents Tanzania Prisons are placed fifth with nine points. They have won two matches and drawn three games, Tanzania Prisons have netted eight goals and conceded four goals.
