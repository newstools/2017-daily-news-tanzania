He was speaking in Zanzibar after attending a Sunday Holy Mass at St Joseph Catholic Church at Minara Miwili parish to where the First Lady, Janeth, accompanied him. Dr Magufuli said Mwalimu Nyerere who died 18 years ago fought against graft and protected the country’s natural resources by all means. In the church, the president contributed 1m/- and 5m/- to the church’s choir and development, respectively. Speaking during the mass, Zanzibar’s Diocese Bishop Augustino Shao asked all Tanzanians to support Dr Magufuli on his drive to develop the country notwithstanding the many challenges he is encountering. Citing Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe who fought for his country’s natural resources, Bishop Shao argued that all Tanzanians were duty-bound to support Dr Magufuli. He said under President Magufuli’s reign, the country has witnessed tough war against corruption, impunity and abuse of office as well as instilling discipline in public service. “We cannot say that we are fighting corruption while we still have people obtaining money through dubious deals,’’ he said, charging that all Tanzanians should observe ethics as well as hate corruption.
