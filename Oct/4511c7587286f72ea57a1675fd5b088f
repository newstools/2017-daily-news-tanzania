NEC Chairman Justice Semistocles Kaijage (retired), opening a three-day training for the officers and their assistants here, said: “If we don’t regard and follow election regulations, we will end up with many election cases, plunging the country into the costs that could otherwise be avoided.” Justice Kaijage noted that in recent years, the political awareness has increased in the country, leading to a state of distrust in the elections. He told the officers to work diligently to save the country from unnecessary problems. “You have been entrusted to do this job. The important thing is to be confident and have self awareness. You have to know well your areas of duties,” he told the training participants. He reminded them over their role to build good image of the electoral body to the public, saying the public trust on NEC will be maintained only if its employees display transparency, efficiency and non-political inclined work. The Chairman said the election is procedural and all procedures must be properly followed. “The regulations are the basis for successful election and avoidance of complaints during the election processes, from the issuance of election forms, electing candidates, election campaigns, voting to vote counting and announcing winners,” he explained. He requested the return officers to get rid of ‘business-as-usual’ syndrome, advising them to take advantage of the trainings to sharpen their skills on laws and regulations governing the elections. The workshop was also attended by NEC Director Ramadhan Kailima and other senior officials. Earlier, Mr Kailima said the by-elections are scheduled for November 26, 2017 in 43 wards, with 336,182 registered voters in the Permanent Register expected to vote in the by-elections through 893 poll centres.
