The laboratory is located at the Mahinya Training Centre for Sustainable Agriculture and Livestock, a vocational school built in 2007 with Italian funding at Nambehe village in Namtumbo district and run with the support of an Italian NGO ‘Cooperazione Paesi Emergenti’ (COPE). The laboratory has been set up with financial support of the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) within the framework of the Fair Agro-zootechnical Regional Empowerment project (FARE) in Tanza nia, funded by the Italian government. FARE project aims at boosting development of the local dairy industry in Namtumbo and Songea districts by improving the quality of local veterinary services, creating new employment and income opportunities for local farmers through on-the-job training and promotion of farmers’ associations, with a specific focus on enhancing women’s economic inclusion and the local milk market. “… with the largest cattle population among the EAC member states, Tanzania has the potential to become the biggest dairy producer in the Region. I do believe the dairy sector is crucial for rural development, poverty reduction and food and nutrition security. Yet, its potential is still to be fully exploited,” the envoy said. He added that challenges stem from various constraints, including technological, capacity and organizational ones. “To overcome these challenges the COPE’s project intends to develop market linkages between small-scale producers in rural and peri-urban areas and milk collection centers. These interventions fit in the broader aim to progressively develop formal, structured value chains led by the private sector, with the aim to enhance productivity, milk quality, food safety and value addition,” he added. Dr Mahenge stressed on the importance of the FARE project to improve households income thus contributing to the economic development of the nation.
