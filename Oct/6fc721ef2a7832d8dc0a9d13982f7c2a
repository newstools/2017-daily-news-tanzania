The Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Charles Mlingwa, was smiling broadly as officials from the World Education Inc. (WEI) outlined plans for the project branded ‘Waache Wasome’ (Let them study) that is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Speaking before the region’s District Commissioners (DCs), District Executive Directors (DEDs), members of the regional secretariat and other stakeholders subsequently, Dr Mlingwa said the programme would cover Musoma District Council, Musoma Municipal Council and parts of Tarime District was significant as they face enormous challenges related to the education sector. The RC said the situation in parts of the region was pathetic as adolescent girls were ill-treated and denied from accessing education opportunities, stressing that other stakeholders should join the government in its spirited efforts to overcome barriers that hindered children’s advancement. Dr Mlingwa ordered the DCs, DEDs and other officials to work closely with WEI officials and civil societies that would be local partners, to ensure that the project succeeds, as it would constitute a huge input into the region’s drive to attain zero Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The Director of Child Development in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, the Elderly and Children, Ms Margareth Musae, hailed the project, saying WEI followed all the procedures and had the government’s full blessings, as the project matched its policies and plans. Unveiling the plan, the WEI Country Director, Ms Lilian Badi, sketched the organisation’s similar operations in other parts of the country such as in Karatu District Council.
