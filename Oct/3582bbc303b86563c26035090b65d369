TBS Marketing Officer, Ms Debora Haule made the call in Iringa yesterday at the ongoing Tourism Expo which was launched on Friday by the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Prof Jumanne Maghembe. According to Ms Haule, the standard mark is gateway for opening up new markets for their products among other avenues. “Majority of the small and medium manufacturers are still operating their businesses without the standard mark which is hindering their business from growing…it is part of our responsibility to create awareness for people to learn the importance of such a requirement,” said Ms Haule. He took the opportunity to assure manufacturers that his organisation will issue the standard mark to products that only match the criteria set for the good welfare of the public. The Marketing Officer pointed out that using the mark is also a way to increase productivity as well as encourage the standard of products manufactured in the country. “The goal of TBS is to ensure that the market is flooded by certified and standard goods a move that will make it easy to deal with counterfeits and substandard goods,” she noted. The Tourism Expo launch was held in hand in hand with Southern Highland Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) exhibition on products to be used by tourists and those delivering the service. In his remarks, the Minister observed that tourism has the largest contribution in country’s GDP and has had impact on the employment and growth of other sectors. “Tourism contributes about 17.5 percent of the GDP and 11 percent of employment in the country comes from the sector,” said Prof Maghembe.
