Prime Minister, Mr Kassim Majaliwa said this during the climax of Disaster Reduction International Day marked at national level in Dodoma, yesterday. In his speech which was read on his behalf by Assistant Director, Disaster Management Department in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Mr Bashiru Taratibu, Premier Majaliwa directed local government leaders in the country to assure citizens in their areas of jurisdictions construct their buildings on planned plots. Government figures show that at least 1.5 million out of 3.5 million plots have been surveyed and planned. At the event themed, “Safe Home: Reducing Exposure, Reducing Displacement,” the Premier said the government has developed a major plan for improving residences across the country. He added that the campaign was targeted at accomplishing requirements by the Sendai Seven Campaign – 7 Targets, 7 Years launched last year by the United Nation Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). During the event at Dodoma’s famous Nyerere Square grounds, citizens got ample opportunity to learn various issues pertaining to the Disaster Management Act, 2015 as well as other relevant regulations. “The big challenge we face at minimising the level of disasters in the country is poor awareness among most members of communities over how to avert them. For example, many people continue to construct their houses in disaster prone areas like valleys and areas with earthquake possibilities,” said Mr Taratibu.
