The dead were identified as Selina Hando (35) from Babati; Amina Saha (50), a Duru villager, Hiit Gwande (50) from Riroda, Elizabeth Hilonga (25) from Heloton, John Timothy (17) and the driver, Wilson Daudi aka Simba (46), whose 15-year-old son’s name was not immediately established. Initial reports indicated that the newlyweds, Mr Philip Samuel and Ms Flora Baso, were among the survivors, when the vehicle in which they were passengers – a Noah with registration number T 740 DJQ was knocked down by a lorry. The driver of the Noah and his son died on the spot, and the bride was seriously hurt. The driver of the truck (registration number T 449 CDR) owned by Lake Hill Paradise Ltd of Singida, fled after the accident. The Manyara Regional Traffic Officer (RTO), Ms Mary Kipesha, remarked that the driver of the smaller vehicle was at fault, remarking: “He turned right without signalling his intention by flashing the indi cator, prompting the speeding lorry driver to ram into the car, after failing to stop abruptly.” Hanang District Hospital medical officer on-duty, Mr Chawokiwa Msangi, said they had preserved the seven bodies of the casualties, and were attending the survivors, except the bride, who was referred to Hydom Hospital. Those admitted at Tumaini District hospital are Philip Samuel, Faustine Sebastian, Samuel Nade and Lina Isack. Two others whose names were yet to be established, were treated and released. Getasam villag ers blamed the Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) for not placing important signposts on the roads, to which they attributed many accidents. This is the fourth accident to occur at an area with feeder roads adjoining the Singida – Arusha Highway in less than 18 months. The accidents have claimed 17 lives, leaving 14 injured.
