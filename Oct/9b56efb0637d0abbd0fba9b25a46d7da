This was said by bank’s head of Human Resources, Mr Frederick Kanga at the launch of its 33rd branch on the University of Dodoma (UDOM) Main Campus in the country’s capitalDodoma. According to Mr Kanga, the expansion of Exim Bank operations in Dodoma were also to complement President John Magufuli’s industrial policy as well as government decision to relocate its administration from the port city of Dar es Salaam to the semi-arid region of Dodoma. “There are more than 25,000 students at the University. In addition the University hosts about eight ministries … all of which will need financial services,” he said. “This is just the beginning we’re targeting to add more branches in the municipality as well as capture the EAC market.” Exim, the fourth largest bank in Tanzania by market value has also a footprint in Djibouti, Comoros and Uganda. Mr Kanga however explained that expansion of the bank’s operation in Dodoma is critical to the transformation of agriculture sector. “We intend to further support effective production of the region’s main crop--grape.” Dodoma District Commissioner Ms Christina Mndeme speaking on behalf of the Regional Commissioner Mr Jordan Rugimbana said “expansion of the bank was timely as the region expect to host numerous investors.” “We expect the service must be affordable for both the poor and the rich. There is a large group of people who are always not considered-- the informal sector such as the Mama Ntilies. It is in our expectation the bank will also consider their presence.” According to the commissioner, industrialisation is coming to Dodoma so is the need for financial institution to be able to issue affordable loans to all the people.
