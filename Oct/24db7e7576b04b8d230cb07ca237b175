According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) Economic bulletin for the quarter ending June credit to the manufacturing and trade sectors grew by 16.6 per cent and 16.1 per cent respectively compared to negative 4.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent of the previous quarter. However, the increase in credit to all major economic activities grew at a slower pace in the period under review despite strong performance on manufacturing and trade. Total domestic credit by the banking system declined by 4.1 percent year on-year in June 2017 compared with an increase of 23.7 percent in June 2016. Trade and personal loans continued to hold the largest share of total bank outstanding loans with respective shares of 21.6 percent and 18.8 percent. Meanwhile, Central government borrowing from the banking system declined by 21.0 percent, on net terms, compared to an increase of 41.1 percent in the year ending June 2016. This reflects building-up of government deposits at the BoT following improvement in domestic revenue collection, streamlined expenditure and realisation of non-concessional borrowing. During the quarter under review, the extended broad money supply expanded by 1.37bn/- equivalent to the growth of 6.1 percent to 23.88bn/- compared with an increase of 2.54bn/- or 12.7 percent growth recorded in the year ending June 2016. The slowdown in the growth of money supply was driven by a moderate growth of credit to private sector by banks and decline in government borrowing from the banking system. Net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system grew by 29.5 per cent in the year ending June 2017 compared to a decline of 6.9 per cent in the corresponding period in 2016. The expansion in NFA of the banking system was on account of accumulation of official foreign assets by the Bank of Tanzania following net purchase of foreign exchange from the public sector in the interbank foreign exchange market.
