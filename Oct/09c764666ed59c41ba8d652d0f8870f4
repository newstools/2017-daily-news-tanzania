A last minute winner by Abdallah Chuma decided the closely-contested match at the Amaan Stadium, as Police came out on top, leaving Miembeni City cracking their teeth. Speaking after the match, Seif rued the last minute lapses in defence, which enabled their opponents bag in the all – important goal. “We made a mistake and it cost us, we need to go back to the drawing board and evaluate ourselves and plan for the next games,” Seif said. On his, Polisi assistant coach Mohammed Abass said his team’s late win was courtesy to his players’ experience, however, bemoaned their poor conversion rate, saying they were wasteful especially in the first half. “We created a lot of chances in the first half but we failed to translate them into goals and kept them in the game, we should have killed the game early on,” claimed Abass.
