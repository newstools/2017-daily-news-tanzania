A statement issued in Dar es Salaam by the Director of Information Services Department, MAELEZO, who doubles as the Government Spokesperson, Dr Hassan Abbasi, said the information was misleading and caused panic among the people. He added that the article was also against Section 54(1) of the Information Services Act No.12 of 2016. Dr Abbasi noted that although the Editor apologized for publishing such misleading information, the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports used power entrusted under Section 59 of the Information Services Act, after issuing several reminders to the editor on their obligation to abide by laws and the basis governing the profession. He said the newspaper had committed several offences which included publishing a ‘cooked’ story in its edition number 4381 of December 2 last year titled “Dangote Aivuruga Serikali” (Dangote confuses the government). The writer wrote false information regarding Minister for Industries, Trade and Investment and failed to validate the information and was given a strong warning. In its edition number 4563 on May 17, this year, the publication carried an article titled “Mchanga Hofu Tupu “ coupled with mockery and defamation against the government quoting the Attorney General George Masaju. The editor admitted that the quotations were not from the AG and apologised through a letter with reference number FML 17/ ADM/VOL.012 dated May 31, 2017. He said that in another publication number 4647 of August 24 this year, the editor also published a story titled “Polisi wasaka Bombadier kwa Lissu” (Police searches Bombardier at Lissu’s premises). “This article to a large extent showed disrespect to the government and Police Force who are responsible for ensuring safety of the people and their properties and also interferes with legal investigation. The editor was required to apologise but he did not do it on time. He was required to apologise on August 25, 2017 but instead he did it on August 26 this year.
