The Minister of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Prof Joyce Ndalichako said in Dar es Salaam yesterday after launching two Barclays Bank initiatives of ‘Twendekazi’ and ‘Balozimwanafunzi’. “The bank’s initiatives are complimenting government efforts to expand education and skills development for more students particularly those with special needs in order to participate in building the national economy,” she said. Prof Ndalichako witnessed the signing of an agreement between Barclays Bank and the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) on the implementation of the Balozimwanafunzi initiative. Of all the higher learning institutions in the country, UDSM is the first to get involved in the initiative where 23 undergraduate students will be offered full year scholarship from this academic year. Over 160m/- will be spent by Barclays Bank in facilitating the scholarship programme. Prof Ndalichako said the programmes are important in preparing the young graduates to be productive and competitive in the labour market and at work places. She urged other institutions to emulate Barclays bank in supporting the government initiatives in education and skills development. This year alone the government allocated 487bn/- to lend students through Loans Board, the amount which is insufficient to cover total demands. Barclays Bank Board Chairman Mr Simon Mponji said supporting education and skills development to young entrepreneurs is for the bank key element of achievement that will in the future contribute to increase financial inclusion.
