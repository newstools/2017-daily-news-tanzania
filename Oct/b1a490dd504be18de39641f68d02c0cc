Tanzania Association of Tour Operators (TATO) said yesterday in Arusha that its members in collaboration with Frankfurt Zoological Society and Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) would deliberate and introduce the new conservation initiative during the day. TATO Chairman, Mr Wilbard Chambulo said that his members and other stakeholders have decided to discuss about new conservation challenges facing the country to recognise Mwalimu Nyerere’s outstanding contribution on conservation drive. “This year, we are observing Nyerere-Day in Arusha with an intention of raising awareness on importance of conservation in the wake of declining wildlife population in Tanzania” Mr Chambulo noted. For instance, Tanzania will have no elephant left by 2020, possibly earlier at current rates of loss. The Black rhino population is so small and a surge of poaching would wipe them out in months. The few black rhinos remaining are protected at great expense, as their future is precarious if the situation will be left unabated. “It is indeed; clear that Mwalimu Nyerere had left a legacy which today made nature based tourism the top foreign exchange earner in the country” TATO boss said. According to TATO CEO, Sirili Akko, poaching ranks high, among others, threatening the wildlife and ultimately a thriving 2.05 billion US dollar tourism industry. “It is an open secret that if Tanzanians do not conserve their wildlife and look after their natural assets then nature based tourism will fail and with it they will lose employment prospects for thousands of people” Mr Akko noted. Wildlife tourism in Tanzania continues to grow, with more than one million guests visiting the country annually, earning the country 2.05 billion US dollars nearly 17.6 per cent of GDP.
