At least 45 professionals were drawn for Wednesday’s first round which teed off the campaign for the “Green Jacket” plus cash prizes in the Kenyan Sh1 million tournament at the Leisure Lodge Beach and Golf Resort in Mombasa, Kenya. The competition for the first time includes two female pros, Kenyan Bhavi Shah and Ugandan Flavia Namakula. Kadio emerged among the top 20 golfers who made a cut after the second round on Thursday at the event that brings together the top East African professional golfers. He sits at the 14th position after the third round yesterday with total 231 (76,76,79) gross. Kadio told the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ from Mombasa yesterday that the competition is very tough especially for the visitors. “It is not an easy event, there is high wind and humid weather at Leisure course because it is located near Indian Ocean, a situation that makes it a highly challenging course,” said Kadio. He added that he is now looking forward to work hard at least to reduce the gap with leaders in today’s final round. Kadio has wonderful performance at Diani Beach Masters as back in 2004, he became the only Tanzanian golfer to win the Trophy. Other local pros who failed to make it were Jimmy Mollel, Nuru Mollel, Rodrick John, Elisante Lembris, John Leonce, Fadhil Nkya and Dar based Zimbabwean Farayi Chitengwa. Jimmy who recently made the Tanzania proud after making cut in Uganda Professional Golf Championship in Kampala said late arrival in Mombasa cost them dearly. “The competition was tough, but as you know in golf you compete against the course, we arrived in Mombasa on Tuesday night we could not have enough time to practice before the Wednesday tee off,” said Jimmy. He complement Kadio for the progress and said they planned to try their luck at CDF Trophy which teed off at the Tanzania People’s defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo club course in Dar es Salaam.
