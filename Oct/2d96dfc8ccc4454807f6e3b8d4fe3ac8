Announcing the decision on behalf of the other members in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Mr Mwigamba said among the many reasons which pushed them to ditch the opposition side was the speed and direction displayed by the president. Mr Mwigamba, who has served in a number of positions in the opposition party, argued that the party has now lost direction and working outside its fundamental principles. “Following the current situation inside the party, some of us have decided to discard our membership,” he said. However, he stressed that their decision must be respected as they have the right to join any political party according to the country and party’s constitutions. After a thorough research, Mr Mwigamba said they decided to join the ruling party, CCM, as it is now working to improve lives of the ordinary citizens. On the war against corruption, he commended the fifth phase government’s current move in fighting against corruption, saying the move is in line with the party’s Tabora Declaration which, according to him, has been abandoned. “According to chapter 17 and 18 of the party’s Tabora Declaration, we were pushing for restoring efficient and effective public service delivery and end grand corruption in public offices that had reached critical levels, but CCM under the leadership of President Magufuli who is also the party’s chairman is implementing them,” he said. Mr Mwigamba and his nine party members are the first team of high profile ACT members trooping into the ruling party. Others are Peter Mwambuja (former party’s accountant), Mwantum Mgonja (former legal officer), Dennis Chembo (former secretary of integrity), and Emmanuel Kitundu (former party’s Administrative officer). Others are Wilfred Kitundu (Singida region Chairman), Lipuloti Robert (party’s Secretary in Singida region), Nakamia John (Chairman Singida Urban), Dan Olotu (Former Arusha Secretary) and Wilson Laizer (Arusha Secretary).
