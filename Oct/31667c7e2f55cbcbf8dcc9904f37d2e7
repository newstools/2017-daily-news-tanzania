Mpangala said the participating teams are those which finished in top six at this year’s Kili Super League. He named them as Savio, JKT, Vijana, Oilers, Pazi and Tanzania Prisons. “This tournament has long history. It started in late 90s up to 2007, when it was held for the last time, by then, it was christened Kili Super Cup,” he explained. He added that after almost a ten –year lull, the wellknown event will back this year. According to Mpangala, the aim of the tournament is to bring back old memories and restore competitions spirit among teams. “We are thinking about increasing competitiveness among teams, players ... the more you play, the more you get experience and become efficient,” Mpangala insisted.
