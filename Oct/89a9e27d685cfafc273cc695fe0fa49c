All three goals were netted in the last segment courtesy of a brace from Juma Ramadhani, who scored in a space of five minutes before Marco Jerad’s right-footed strike sealed off the win. The first match on the day saw Heroes bowing down 1-0, to Azam FC in another highly contested encounter, which gave the Ice-cream makers a huge test. Commenting shortly after the two games, Head of Youth Football Development, Kim Poulsen said they learnt a lot from the double friendly encounters, which will help the entire technical bench to select the best players from the rest. “The overall performance of players was exceptional and I’m totally impressed with their hardworking spirits. “In one way or the other, the boys have proved that they can equally challenge big teams in Mainland League something I believe will accelerate the players’ morale when they want to play against big clubs,” Poulsen said. Asked whether they are planning to play other friendly matches with only one week remaining before the camp is dissolved, Poulsen said they would like to play more games, but the Mainland Premier League resumes next week hence big clubs will be busy to engage them. It was the first friendly matches for Ngorongoro Heroes to play in their second week of three weeks camp, which is being conducted at Karume Memorial Stadium in the city. Initially, the technical bench selected 50 players in the provisional squad but the number was trimmed down to 40 this week and more players will be dropped. The aim of the camp is to get competitive crop of players, who will be used for the upcoming 2018 U-20 AFCON qualifications.
