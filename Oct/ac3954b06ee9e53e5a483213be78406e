The chairmanship elections for the party at district level are pencilled for October 5 and 6, this year. CCM Ideology and Publicity Secretary, Humphrey Polepole told reporters in Dar es Salaam that the NEC meeting held in Dar es Salaam yesterday, unanimously agreed to direct the districts to start afresh the election process for the posts, after it discovered that their candidates lacked the required qualifications. He explained that the members discovered that the candidates in four districts namely Makete, Moshi Urban, Siha and Hai lacked qualifications as per the party’s rules governing the election. “The meeting was satisfied that there were a lot of irregularities surrounding the selection of candidates and they were not suitable for serving the party,” he said. Mr Polepole added that the meeting also directed the formation of two party’s districts from Musoma administrative district, which are Musoma Urban and Musoma Rural. “Following this decision, the election for all party leaders in these two districts will be announced soon to give chance for CCM members from the areas to elect their leaders,” he said. He, however, reminded all candidates who are vying for various posts in the ongoing internal elections and those who have already been elected to abide by the party’s constitution, election regulations and leadership code. He warned that the party will not hesitate to nullify elections for candidates who will go against the requirements including engaging in corruption. Mr Polepole also said that as part of transformation, the party is still insisting on one portfolio per person. He noted those who have vied for more than one post should reconsider their decision and will be required to opt for one post.
