Revenue statistics were made available in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the Tanzania Revenue Authority director for taxpayer services and education, Richard Kayombo. Mr Kayombo noted that the target for FY 2017/2018 was estimated at 17.1tri/- which he said he would beat. “We are confident that we will meet that target as in July we collected 1.1tri/- while in August 1.2tri/- and for September 1.34 tri/-, the authority continues to collect various taxes including payments of property tax executed recently,” he noted. According to TRA statistics, in the first quarter of 2016/2017 fiscal year monthly collection for July stood at 1 tri/-, August 1.12 tri/- and September was 1.28 tri/-. Mr Kayombo further said up to July 2017, the authority has collected 34bn/- countrywide as property tax, and he reminded the general public to start paying their property taxes earlier for the 2017/18 financial year instead of waiting for ‘D-days’. “People should start paying their taxes earlier instead of waiting until the final days.We have almost 365 days ahead to the coming financial year, we are hoping this time people will pay their property taxes on time,” he said. Mr Kayombo has also warned businesspeople against using forged receipts, saying they risk being prosecuted. He further said customers should not end up claiming a receipt only after purchasing something, but they must make sure the receipt has accurate details including the date and amount paid. For the purpose of ensuring maximum revenue collection TRA has encouraged the use of Electronic Fiscal Device (EFD) machines. “I would like to remind the general public to verify the electronic receipts issued if they are genuine by checking the date, amount paid and the product bought before leaving the premises, if you notice any disproportion please report to any TRA offices or call our call Centre on 0800 750075 or 0800780078,” he said. Meanwhile, the taxman has reminded operators of gaming activities and casino to pay their taxes timely according to Gaming Act No. 41 and as per Finance Act 2017.
