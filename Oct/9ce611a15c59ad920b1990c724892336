While many countries have long-established bans on lead paints, are still in the Tanzania market countrywide for use in homes, schools and other buildings. Senior Programme Officer at AGENDA, an environment NGO, Ms Dorah Swai, said in Dar es Salaam that Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) should not wait until the year 2020 to phase out paints with lead substances from the market. “We are aware that TBS align to a global target for all countries to have lead paint controls by 2020 set by the Lead Paint Alliance, which was formed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2009 but why should we wait that long to protect our children?” she noted. Ms Swai supplemented that several paint manufacturers have taken voluntary action to stop adding lead compounds to their decorative paints; it was high time for others to implement the same.
