The two-day global event themed ‘Making Finance Work for Women Summit’ will be held in Dar es Salaam on 24-25 this month. “More than one billion women around the world do not have access to formal financial services,” said Mary Ellen Iskenderian, President and CEO of Women’s World Banking. “We are honoured that the VP joins us to welcome global leaders who are harnessing the latest technologies and innovative approaches to reaching these women,” Local co-host NMB Bank will join the global Non-Government Organization (NGO) Women’s World Banking to welcome 300 executives from the financial services, consumer products and technology industries as well as investors, philanthropists and government representatives from more than 30 countries. Participants will examine the best practices in researching, designing and delivering products to low-income women. The Making Finance Work for Women Summit will feature speakers committed to reaching low-income women, including Ineke Bussemaker, NMB Bank Managing Director who will join the opening plenary session. According to the most recent World Bank Global Findex data, only 17 percent of women in Tanzania have an account at a formal financial institution. NMB and Women’s World Banking are currently working together to better understand the banking needs of women and youth throughout Tanzania and to design financial products that meet those needs. “We are thrilled to co host this esteemed event with Women’s World Banking. We welcome experts from around the world to our home in Tanzania, and look forward to the opportunity to share and learn from colleagues at the forefront of delivering vital financial services to women,” said Ms Bussemaker, who serves on Women’s World Banking’s Board of Directors.
