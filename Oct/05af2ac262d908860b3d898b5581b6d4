This was revealed in Dar es Salaam recently by the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Eldery and Children, Dr Mpoki Ulisubisya. It was one of the issues that emerged during a video conference at the Tanzania Global Learning Agency (TaGLA). He disclosed that discussions were ongoing between the government and Guilin Pharmaceuticals Company based in Shanghai on the envisaged factory, whose products would be immensely helpful in curbing malaria in neighbouring countries. “Our Chinese friends have agreed to construct the factory as part of their support to President John Magufuli’s government’s drive to turn Tanzania into an industrial economy. The factory will certainly make a big impact in the battle against malaria,” Dr Mpoki said. The PS explained that as part of the preliminary phase to that end, the government and the Chinese firm would sign a contract under which a plot would be given to the latter, on which the factory would be located. He said the factory will enable the country intensify the battle against the deadly disease, since the cost of importing the drugs from China would be substantially re duced. Dr Ulisubisya said Tanzania was one of the tropical countries that were hardest hit by the killer disease, into whose control, at best and elimination at worst, the government had invested much efforts and many resources. The video conference drew participants from eight African countries that get supplies of Artesunate and injection drugs from Guilin Pharmaceutical Company. Alongside Tanzania were Kenya, Uganda , Malawi, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Gambia and Ghana.
