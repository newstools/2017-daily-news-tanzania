The villagers put the application before the Deputy Minister of Land, Housing and Human Settlement Development, Ms Angelina Mabula (pictured) , who visited the place to ascertain availability of land and compliance with the law among stakeholders. Speaking on behalf of the villagers, Ms Fatuma Mango said they had amicably agreed to set aside some 472 acres for construction of the factory while some 47 others earmarked as an area where raw materials for the industry would be quarried. She said it has taken a long time for the mission to be accomplished and villagers were worried if the project would proceed. The village has 664 households and a population of 4,646. The deputy minister said investment is always a process, and laws of the land have to be adhered to; hence she had to call to the area to see if what was on writing was real on site. She said the process started in 2012 and it took a long time because of ignorance of law among some stakeholders. Ms Mabula said she was satisfied with what she read, heard and saw, and she was to recommend to the president that the area and the stakeholders were ready for the investment so that he affirms the same if it would be well with his office. “I have come to see you, see the place, and speak to you so that I satisfy myself and the office that every procedure required in land transfer and investment is observed and in line with laws of the United Republic of Tanzania so that I can go and tell the president that everything is ready. For me it is okay, we will wait for him to assent or otherwise,” said the minister. Speaking at the meeting, the prospective investor, Mr James Mtei said putting in place the industry will cost 120bn/- and that initially it will employ 250 people directly and the number is set to rise up to 3,600 with time.
