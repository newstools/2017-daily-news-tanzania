Deputy Director of Mbeya Referral Hospital, Mr Thomas Isdory revealed this to the Mbeya Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Amos Makalla, who visited the facility to inspect the ongoing construction of an x-ray building. He said that they entered into an agreement with UDSM to establish a university in Mbeya for training doctors, laboratory specialists and nurses. Mr Isdory said the university will help curb the problem of healthcare providers including specialist doctors and laboratory personnel. Mbeya RC hailed the move saying it will help to improve service provision in health centres and district hospitals. “This is another positive step in the health sector. I know that during practical training they will be dispersed to various parts of the country,” he said, adding that people from rural areas will benefit from the university. Meanwhile, from early next year, MRH will stop referring patients to Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) as all patients including those with heart and kidney diseases will be treated here. The hospital’s Deputy Director, said due to lack of an x-ray building, they were forced to refer patients to MNH in Dar es Salaam, but all patients will be attended at the hospital. He said that already they have an x-ray specialist and his assistants and they have received three doctors from Cuba and before December, this year, four doctors will arrive from China. He added that the construction of the building will cost 2.1 billion/- and the contractor Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) has assured them that by early January, next year, he will hand over the building. RC Makalla said the completion of the building will be a relief to the residents of the Southern Highlands zone as they will no longer travel to Dar es Salaam or India for treatment.
