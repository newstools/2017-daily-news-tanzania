That is according to figures released by the education sector NGO, Haki Elimu in Arusha over the weekend. Its Executive Director, Mr John Kalaghe, pointed out that, water problems were behind many dropout cases in academic institutions. Pricked by the trend, Haki Elimu has injected over 20 million/‑ into an envisaged water project at Mukulat Secondary School, which is located in the drought striken part of Arumeru District. Mr Kalaghe handled the cheque for the money to the Headmaster, Mr Vitalis Nada, who remarked: “It is surprising that, in spite of being located in a nomadic Maasai pastoral community, the school has a high number of female students.” Mr Nada had earlier explained that the institution had 465 female students, while boys numbered 252. “The need for clean water by female students surpasses that of their male counterparts, and that’s why when we heard about the problem, and the fact that girls outnumber boys, we swiftly decided to step in with assistance, the NGO’s boss said during the 20th ordinary level graduation ceremony. A total of 128 students graduated at Mukulat Secondary School, among them 90 girls and 38 boys. Apparently, female students surpassed their male counterparts even at completing in the Form Four Class. “Only 84 of the 465 girls were borders, meaning that the majority were day students for whom the long treks to and from school were tortuous,” the headmaster said. The distance ranged be‑ tween seven and 15 kilometres, he explained further, pointing out that this left them too acutely exhausted to grasp lessons effectively.
