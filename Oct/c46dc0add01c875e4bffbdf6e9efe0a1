The examination authority also directed the owners of private secondary schools to realize that their schools now are special centres for the national exams so they should not in any way interfere with the role of the supervisors throughout the examination period. NECTA made it clear that failure to adhere to the directive, the schools risk facing closure, among others. According to the authority’s Executive Secretary, Dr Charles Msonde, the candidates are expected to write the exams at 4,787 secondary schools and in 1,064 private centres. Detailing further, Dr Msonde affirmed that 323,513 are school candidates while the remaining 62,425 are private candidates. He said out of 322,513 school candidates who have registered, boys are 159,103 equivalent to 49.18 per cent and girls are 164,410 equivalent to 50.82 per cent. Private candidates are 62,425 who have registered to seat for the Form Four national examinations whereby males are 28,574 equivalent to 45.77 per cent and 33,851 are female which is equivalent to 54.23 per cent. Last year the school candidates registered to seat for the Form Four national examinations were 355,822 and 52,550 were registered as private candidates. “The council would like to use this opportunity to urge the Regional and Municipal Councils committees of examinations to ensure all procedures for operating national examinations are considered and respected and make sure that the environment of the centres is safe and quiet with no indication of cheating,” said Dr Msonde in Dar es Salaam yesterday. He further said that in this year a total of 16,279 students have registered to write for the Qualifying Test (QT) where 6,725 equivalent to 41.31 per cent and females are 9,554 equivalent to 58.69 per cent. Last year the candidates registered to write for QT examinations were 20,655. NACTE has also warned teachers and members of community in general not to involve in any incident of cheatings during the examination because the council will take legal action for those who would be found involved in cheatings for the examinations according to the procedures of public service and laws of the country. Speaking at the same occasion, the Dar es Salaam Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS), Ms Theresia Mmbando on behalf of other secretaries in the country, who are the chairpersons of the regional and municipal councils’ examinations committees said supervisors and head of examination’s centres have already been trained to follow all procedures. “We believe they will obey procedures of operating examinations as they have been trained, we believe they will avoid cheating incidents and environment of centres will be quiet and safe,” she said.
