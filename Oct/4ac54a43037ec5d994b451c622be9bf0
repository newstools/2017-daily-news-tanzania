The coach said that prior to the team’s departure to Shinyanga yesterday. Maxime said the match will be tough, but urged Kagera Sugar fans to continue supporting the team. “We are still confident of winning the match and others on the fixture as the league is still at infancy. Kagera fans must be patient. Soccer is a tricky game…..there are teams which conceded many goals,” he said citing Brazil, winners of the 1958, 1962, 1970,1994 and 2002 World Cup who were humiliated 7-1 at the semi-final stage by Germany in the World Cup they hosted four years ago. Kagera Sugar will be banking on striker Ludovik Venant who scored a goal during their encounter against visiting Ruvu Shooting. The match ended 1-1. Striker Jaffary Kibaya will also be looking for a spectacular performance after levelling for Kagera in the 52nd minute in their 2-1 loss to the defending champions Young Africans at the Kaitaba Stadium. Kagera Sugar are trailing on 16th position with just two points in their kit from six matches. They have scored two goals while conceding six goals.Mwadui FC, on the other hand, are placed 12th in the league table with five points also from six matches. Mwadui have conceded eleven goals and have netted five goals. Kagera Sugar will return to Bukoba after their match against Mwadui ready to host Njombe Mji at the Kaitaba stadium. Simba are leading the league table with twelve points from six matches. They tie with Mtibwa and the defending champions Yanga on 12 points, but Simba are placed top due to the superior goal average.
