The call was made here by 16-year old Magreth Laurent during her session with management of Kongwa District. She has been acting as the District Executive Director, a post she held to mark the girl child international day. “A girl child today is tomorrow’s leader. The public needs to give a chance to a girl child to build such talent,” the form three student at St Francis Secondary School in Kongwa said. She said such opportunities need to be open at different levels in the community because it will help build better leaders to help the nation. Ms Faraja Kasuwi, the Kongwa District Community Development Officer, said the council is implementing a number of strategies seeking to enhance involvement of a girl child at various leadership posts in the community. “We believe this is the best option to create and sustain future leaders,” she said. Ms Kasuwi, meanwhile urged members of the community to change and accept working with younger female leaders. Citing the country’s Vice President, Ms Samia Hassan Suluhu, the officer noted that the country’s second citizen was groomed to become a leader at a younger age. This year, the nationwide celebration of a girl child day will be held in Musoma in Mara, and will be themed “abolish or fight against child pregnancy and enhance industrial economy in Tanzania”.
