All are including Mbwana Samatta, who plays for the Belgian topflight outfit, KRC Genk, Simon Msuva who plays for a Moroccan premier league club Difaa El Jadida and Farid Mussa from Deportive Tenerife. It is good and highly motivating to see them all responding to the coach Salum Mayanga’s call to serve the nation. This describes both maturity for our players and pride to play for their country on the other hand. The players are back to serve the nation just a month after helping Tanzania secure a 2-0 victory over Botswana Zebras with both goals coming from Simon Msuva. We believe their presence will help heighten again Tanzanian position in the FIFA World rankings as it was during their win over Botswana. More than that, their service to the nation is crucial as it helps build a bright future for the youth basing on the fact that superior position in the world rankings opens doors for the youth to play in the big European leagues. That is the pride of playing for Tanzania and all those selected by Mayanga are current the best in the country. They’re there on merit. They are proud to play. They are doing what every Tanzanian wants them to do, and we want them to deliver. We understand their job is to entertain and excite the supporters by scoring, but it’s also to build the winning team that in future will qualify for the World Cup. We would like Taifa Stars to have different opponents in their future games in order to end Malawi-Botswana tag as Stars’ FIFA date opponents. We would like to play countries like Congo DRC, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Zambia or even those far outside the Zone Five circuit to test our players’ skills. The international friendly matches are the tests for Taifa Stars since the East African Senior Challenge Cup turned dormant. We end up by wishing our envoys a successful mission against Malawian Flames; hopefully they will do it again this time around similarly to three previous encounters.
