Kibondo District Administrative Secretary (DAS) Ayub Sebalile said yesterday that without proper education on standardisation, the state agenda on industrialisation will not record desirable achievement. “Poor understanding on issues of standards on products was an issue among many [rural] manufacturers here [thanks] TBS for initiating this move by extending education to producers at district levels,” Mr Sebalile said. The DAS was speaking to a delegation from TBS which paid a courtesy call in his office in Kibondo. He challenged TBS to extend such education as many villagers especially the youths have opted to venture in small scale manufacturing as way of generating extra revenue on top of agriculture. TBS told briefly DAS that in a week they managed to reach some 6,200 small and medium entrepreneurs in four regions namely Dodoma, Singida, Tabora and Kigoma. TBS Principal Corporate and Public Relations Officer Ms Roida Andusamile said apart from educating manufacturers they recruited stu dents to act as the bureau ambassadors for standardisation education. “We were overwhelmed by the huge turnout during the mission which included sensitisation on issues pertaining to standards and crucial steps the manufacturers should pass through to acquire TBS quality mark,” Ms Andusamile said. The bureau plans more education campaigns in this year targeting Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga and Manyara.
