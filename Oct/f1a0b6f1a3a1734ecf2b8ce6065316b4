Last year, about 13,362 students where 6,810 girls and 6,552 boys attempted the exams, while in the previous year - 2015, about 20,423 students in Kagera Region sat for the same National Form Four examinations. He appealed to invigilators selected to supervise the exams to be vigilant and avoid cheating to enable the nation get good and committed future leaders. “Invigilators should avoid cheating because they have a big role to play in shaping the students to become committed future leaders. Students should also remain calm,” he empathised. He directed headteachers to give students frequent aptitude tests in Standard Seven, Form One and Form Four to sharpen their skills before they attempt national examinations. Mr Kamamba said such tests are essential and enable the students to become well prepared for the exams and avoid what he termed as examinations fever. He urged parents to ensure that they closely follow their students’ school attendance to enable them to know their weakness.
