It all begun few minutes after he had started to table the opposition s budget speech for the 2017/18 financial year for the Ministry of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports.Drama ensued after he had read six pages of his speech, when Mr Mbilinyi wanted to read matters concerning the whereabouts of Mr Ben Saanane, security personnel for the leader of the official opposition in Parliament who disappeared mysteriously in November, last year.But, the House chair directed him to skip the pages containing the matter, a move that was vehemently criticised by Mr Mbilinyi, who insisted on reading the pages to no avail.He later, decided to let it go by not reading the remaining pages after a protracted debate between him and Mr Zungu. The move brought yet another war of words between the opposition Chief Whip Tundu Lissu and his government counterpart Jenister Mhagama.The two sought the Chairman s guidance separately to seek clarification from Mr Zungu. The directive by the House chairman is unfair because it aims at interfering the speeches from the opposition that the government does not want to hear, he said, adding that it was not correct to have opposition speeches censored by the government prior to official tabling in Parliament.But, the House chairman said he was sticking to Parliamentary Standing Orders and that his directive was final. Don t test my patience and if you don t want to heed my directives, you better shun from reading your speech, Mr Zungu told Mr Mbilinyi who is the Mbeya Urban Law Maker.Aggrieved by Mr Lissu s guidance, Ms Mhagama stood up saying that since the opposition chief whip was protecting the interests of the opposition, as the government chief whip, she was equally concerned with serious issues of the government in Parliament. The issue that is being raised by Mr Mbilinyi is currently being handled by responsible authorities and I want to advise that your chair sticks to the Parliamentary Standing Orders.Later in his contribution when debating the ministry s budget estimates, Mr Mbilinyi found himself in yet another tug-of-war with the Minister of State in the President s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), George Simbachawene, when he mentioned a name of a person he describe as Bashite in the National Assembly.
