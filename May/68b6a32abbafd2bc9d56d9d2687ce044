Instead, the government is determined to improve learning environment in secondary schools, which includes construction of classrooms, pit latrines and administration blocks.This was said today by the Deputy Minister for Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training Eng Stella Manyanya, who was responding to a question from Magu legislator, Boniventura Kiswaga (CCM), where she said the government is determined to end the shortage of science teachers and ensure availability of learning and teaching materials at primary and secondary schools.The legislator was concerned that since the government offers free basic education from kindergarten to Form Four, it would be better if it also considers paying fees for Form five and Form six students. We have a shortage of A-Level schools in our country the number of form four candidates who pass their national examinations has been increasing every year, we are now working round the clock to ensure availability of enough schools to accommodate all the students, said Eng Manyanya. She assured the MPs that in a few years there will be a good number of secondary schools with a capacity to enrol form five students. The way we did for ward primary schools and construction of laboratories, our aim is to ensure that most of our secondary schools offer A-Level secondary school education, she said.The deputy minister also informed parliament that the government is now constructing vocational education training colleges at Namtumbo, Ludewa, Kilindi, Chunya and Ukerewe districts. She further said plans are underway to construct a similar college in Lushoto District in Tanga region.Eng Manyanya insisted that construction of vocational education training college in Lushoto will depend on availability of funds. She said although the government is still looking for funds from development partners, district authorities should strive to mobilise funds from its own sources to construct the colleges.She advised residents of Lushoto District to continue using nearby colleges such as the Vocational Education Training Authority (VETA) located in Tanga town and Folk Development Colleges (FDCs) which are in Muheza and Handeni districts.There are 55 established Folk Development Colleges in the country operating under the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children.
