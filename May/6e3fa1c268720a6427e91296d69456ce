 It is a stunning development in our nation s bid to turn around Tanzania s agriculture, the Committee Chairperson, Dr Mary Nagu, said, after a presentation by the Sagcot team on the initiative s activities. I feel that this has been a short meeting; please arrange another one so that we can learn more about what is being done and what has been achieved, she added.She promised that the committee would visit the clusters that were listed down to see how crops were grown and the methods employed to increase production. Another thing I have learnt is the exposure of opportunities in farming to business persons and investors.Obviously investors will depend on bumper harvests of quality crops in order to produce quality industrial products, said Dr Nagu, an experienced manager of public enterprises.Industrial economy, she said, depends on agriculture with inherent productivity and you people are assuring us that there will be productivity in the kind of farming you are pushing for. She said the committee would want to see for itself what SAGCOT is doing on the ground and how it is awakening and making peasants take advantage of the opportunities that abound in farming.It want to see how the initiative is helping peasants discard the mentality that farming is an occupation of the disadvantaged. Committee members said they want to see SAGCOT covering greater geographical area, well beyond the initial corridor embracing southern highlands regions.They also called for protection of the environment, the soil and its enrichment. They furthermore called for preservation of water sources, to facilitate reliable fresh water supply in the future.Presenting the initiative s activities, SACGOT Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey Kirenga told the committee that its core aim was to change Tanzania s peasant farming--- to lift it from subsistence farming to commercial farming and increase peasants output.The initiative, he said, was focusing on proper use of water and land; increasing output per hectare, multiplying crop chain value in order to increase national wealth using agriculture. SAGCOT is a public-private partnership that became operational six years ago.By 2030, SAGCOT partners want to bring 350,000 hectares of land into profitable production, push 100,000 peasants into commercial farming, create 420,000 new jobs and generate 1.2 US billion dollars in annual farming revenue.SAGCOT has six clusters: Ihemi, covering Mbeya, Iringa and Njombe regions, Kilombero cluster in Morogoro Region, Mbarali cluster in Mbeya and Songwe regions, Sumbawanga cluster in Rukwa Region, Ludewa in Ruvuma Region and Rufiji cluster in Coast Region.Ihemi is the operational cluster focusing on production of tomato, paddy, Irish potatoes, Soya beans, maize and dairy products. SACGOT funders are the Government of Tanzania,UK Aid,World Bank Group,Norwegian Embassy,United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and AGRA.
