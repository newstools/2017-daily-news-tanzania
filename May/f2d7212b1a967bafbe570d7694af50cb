A statement from Sophos noted that customers using the IPS rules in XG firewall would have been protected from the exploit spreading the infection from outside their firewall. “Sophos has added identities and generic rules to Sophos Endpoint Protection since then to block all known and potential future variants of the malware. We encourage all customers to deploy the Microsoft patch that mitigates the underlying vulnerability in the Windows operating system,” stated part of the statement. Sophos Labs analysed the “WannaCry” attack on Friday and immediately issued a detection update for customers. The statement said they believe this to be the first example of a commercial malware attack using ransomware techniques that took advantage of an exploit allegedly leaked from the US National Security Agency (NSA) and uses a variant of the ShadowBrokers APT EternalBlue exploit. It noted thatit is imperative that businesses everywhere update their operating systems, their security software and educate their users against phishing attacks, saying that this is a best practice to reduce the risk from any attack.
