The PM, however, advised Tanzanians to grab the opportunity available in market share and buy as many shares as they can before the deadline. The Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) last month extended Vodacom s 476bn/- IPO by three more weeks to May 11, this year.Speaking during a press conference that was also attended by Directors of CMSA, Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), National Economic Empowerment Council (NEEC) and the Vodacom Tanzania Plc in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Mr Majaliwa called upon Tanzanians living inside and outside the country to boost local ownership of the telecom companies, promote transparency in their operations and enable the government get its fair share in form of taxes. This is an opportunity for Tanzanians to be owners of telecom companies and you re also contributing in building individual and national economy.I therefore, advise wananchi to purchase shares before the deadline, he stressed. On the side of public servants, Mr Majaliwa said there are plans that are set by Permanent Secretaries (PSs), adding they should also grab the opportunity to help the government collect taxes without cheating from telecom companies. This is an opportunity for our people, leaders of institutions and public agencies, private institutions, small and medium-enterprises (SMEs), bodaboda riders and Diasporas also to buy shares so that they can contribute to the economy of the country and at the same time they save at home, he added.Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango, said that investment through the purchase of shares is one of the ways of empowering Tanzanians to have ownership of the country s economy. People have been criticising reports which indicate that the country economy is growing because they have no money in their pockets.This is another opportunity which will enable them to improve individual economy, he said.Dr Mpango said communication is among the sectors which are fast growing in the country because in the first quarter of the year the sector has grown by 11.3 per cent, I call upon Tanzanians to purchase Vodacom shares so that we can improve our economy.
