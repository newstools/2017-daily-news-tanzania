Three minutes later, Toto threatened again, this time, Waziri Junior missed from a close range with keeper Beno Kakolanya slightly out of position.Kamusoko forced keeper David Kisu into a full stretch in the 38th minute, to push away a 30 metres low drive to a fruitless corner kick.Then Chirwa forced himself into the box two minutes later, but defenders stood firm to stop him. Yanga were still on ascendancy and in the 42nd minute Kamusoko skipped past few defenders but his shot could not hit the target.With the visitors happy to get numbers behind the ball and sit deep, Yanga struggled to find a way through during an eventful first half.Coach George Lwandamina made changes in the second half, bringing in Deus Kaseke and Emmanuel Martin for Juma Mahadhi and Godfrey Mwaishuya as Yanga continued to look the team more likely to score. They put keeper Kisu and his defenders under siege.On his side, Toto African coach, Fulgence Novatus introduced Waziri Ramadhani for Natoka Mohamed Soud. Toto Africans nearly caught Yanga napping, when Waziri Junior shot narrowly but missed the target in the 53rd.Two minutes later, Niyonzima fired a powerful shot that narrowly missed the top corner as the visitors started to fade off giving the champions- elect more room to push further into their box.In the 74th minute, Haji Mwinyi s fierce shot sailed wide and a minute later, Chirwa missed a chance to score with a miscued header.
