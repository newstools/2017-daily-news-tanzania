All is set for the job expected to start next month with the Company s General Manager Mr Denis Sebugwao saying the explorations have already indicated the possibility of attaining the historical harvests.According to Mr Sebugwao, the explorations undertaken in the Western Zone area of the mine site have shown the deposits amounting to 26,000 ounces and that of the Eastern zone of more than 85,000 ounces. We are glad to announce this historical milestone achieved by our public mining entity with the two areas showing great potential in gold deposits never achieved before and which will be the biggest since the mining commenced in 2014, he said.However, he said the discovery of gold in those areas will require heavy investment of nearly 44 million US dollars (around 90bn/-) with strategies already in place to secure the funds from different sources.Giving a brief statistics, Mr Sebugwao said up to March this year, the company had managed to produce over 51,000 ounces and at least 5,000 ounces of different concentrates all worth 127bn/- Due to the recorded income, the company has paid different revenues to the government of around 35bn/- while Corporate and Social Responsibilities (CSR) obligations worth 515m/- have been offered in the villages surrounding the mine so far.Mr Sebugwao maintained that a number of explorations will be undertaken in the future including the ongoing ones in T 7 area and nine other sites with prospects of attaining over 70,000 ounces that will help in increasing the life span of the mine for another two years.Other master plans in the pipeline include the expansion of the processing plant so that it might increase the capacity to at least twice of the present with the investment expected to cost over 15 million US dollars. Reduction of production cost is one of the major targets and in achieving that we plan to purchase brand new mining machines worth 12 million dollars thanks to the Exim Bank of China which has agreed to sign a loan at an affordable interest rate of 2 percent payable in the period of five years, he said. The purchase of own machines will ease the company from spending 10m/- a year for rented equipment from the private dealers.Another achievement communicated by Mr Sebugwao was the agreement for the connection of power from the national grid that will be made possible before end of next year if all goes well, again relieving the company other millions of money currently paid for running power generators.However, the DM pleaded for continuous support from the government so that the company can manage to effectively undertake its operations and commended the efforts by the Ministry of Energy and Minerals which is about to allocate 10bn/- for funding different costs for at least the next six month.
