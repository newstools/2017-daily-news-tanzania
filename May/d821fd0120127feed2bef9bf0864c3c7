The miner, gold producer, developer and explorer, said in a release that the four-year term loan was for 7.5 Mega Watts power station now in operation.According to Shanta Gold statement issued yesterday, reliable power paved way of delivering the first ore from underground mine in this quarter as planned.Shanta Gold Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Toby Bradbury, said the power station NLGM capacity has more than doubled to 7.5 MW. This power station has proven a great success for the New Luika Gold Mine. It is now delivering reliable power with a significant drop in per kilowatt hour power costs, Mr Bradbury said.In 2016, Shanta decided to pay the capital costs of the power station out of cash flow in anticipation of improved financing terms, which it has now realised with the Exim term loan. The power plant s commissioning in Q1 2017 will serve NLGM for many years and deliver the increased power required to support the new underground operation that remains on schedule to deliver first stope ore this quarter, Mr Bradbury said.The loan, which bears variable interest at 7.25 per cent per annum, has come with a discount of 2.75 per cent below the Exim base lending rate. The company continues to defer non-essential expenditure, while it completes the development of the underground operation, due to the large sum, now outstanding, in VAT refunds, the CEO said.
