Speaking here during the Open Forum for Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) organised training under Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), Cotton Pathologist from Ukiliguru Research Centre Stella Chiriini said cotton has great potential of boosting the national economy and farmers income.The training that attracted extension officers in the district aims at increasing awareness among agro-extension officers on the importance of using modern technology in production of cassava, potatoes and cotton crops in the district. We are supposed to educate our farmers to stick on the production of cotton as their main cash crop in this district... this crop has great potential of increasing farmers income, she said. Nyakariro Ward Agro-extension officer Mariam Alex said the main challenge facing many farmers in the district is the presence of insects that attack crops, especially maize. We hope that our researchers in collaboration with agricultural officers will come up with the solution to encourage farmers to continue cultivating maize crop in Nyakariro ward, she said, adding that the training will help to increase awareness among farmers on modern agriculture technology for their economic progress.Buchosa District Executive Director Crispin Luanda said that more efforts are needed to ensure farmers are using modern farming practices to succeed. If we strive in encouraging farmers to embracenew farming tools in their agricultural activities, they will achieve their goals and increase the national income, he said, advising extension officers to educate farmers on appropriate cotton production practices to increase productivity.Mr Luanda pointed out that farmers should be educated to engage in alternative crops instead of remaining with same produce that has no positive impact.
