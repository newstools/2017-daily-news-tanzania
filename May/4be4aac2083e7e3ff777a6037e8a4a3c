You have been here since 1999 ... if you are making losses why are you still operating? President Magufuli wondered, adding: Tell your business partners that they have to pay dividend. Make sure that you adhere to what s in the contract. You cannot claim you re making losses every year but still remain operating. So I want you to start discussion with TBC and the respective ministry on modalities of paying the dividend, President Magufuli stressed.President Magufuli directed the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sport, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, who accompanied him to look into the contract between Star Media Tanzania Ltd and TBC and take necessary steps if the contract is not beneficial to Tanzania.Startimes, a branding name of Star Media (Tanzania) Limited, is a Technology company that was established in 1988 in China.On its website it describes itself as a pioneer and key player in digital television solution in China and Africa, where it has acquired over 7 million subscribers.
