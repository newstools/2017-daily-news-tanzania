Launched by the Energy and Minerals Parliamentary Committee on Monday, the report on Taxation and the State of Africa Mining Vision implementation , attributed the introduction of mineral audit agency, the Tanzania Minerals Audit Agency (TMAA), to the achievement. This has resulted in identification of unpaid taxes owed, while helping to build the capacity of mining companies to calculate tax revenues payable. Presenting the report to members of the committee, a representative of the Tax Justice Network-Africa (TINA), which conducted the study since 2011, said following the introduction of the Mining Policy of 2009, the country has also undertaken reforms in the tax systems to increase revenue from the mining sector.
