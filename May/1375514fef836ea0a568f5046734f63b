This is the second time that SBL is supporting the national team after a similar three-year sponsorship spell between 2010 and 2012 by the brewer.In the agreement, inked yesterday by SBL Managing Director Helene Weesie and TFF President Jamal Malinzi, the beer company will in return benefit from exclusive marketing rights and brand exposure opportunities during all local and away matches played by the national team.Speaking during the signing of the deal, Weesie reaffirmed the brewer s commitment to support the sports sector in the country, noting sports does not only entertain and unite fans, but a source of income to the youth. We (SBL) feel really honoured to sponsor our national soccer team. We have taken this important step knowing very well the important role that sports play in the nation s socio-economic development.We believe that by supporting Taifa Stars we are contributing to not only the growth of the sports sector but also in reinvigorating local football, a game that Tanzania and the world in general hold so dear, Weesie said.On his part, TFF President, Jamal Malinzi thanked SBL for the support, which he said will go a long way in facilitating effective preparations for the national side and hence lead to better performance. The sponsorship by SBL has come at the right time, a time when the national team is on the preparatory stages for regional and international assignments, Malinzi said.The signing ceremony was also attended by the Minister for Information, Culturem Arts and Sports, Harrison Mwakyembe, who appealed to other companies and wellwishers to consider funding sports through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sponsorship programmes
