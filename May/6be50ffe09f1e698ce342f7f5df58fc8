The management of Saint Patrick Schools apparently has been working to venture further from its current education providing portfolio into establishing what is expected to be the country s largest Sports Training Centre in the Sakina area of Arusha City.The St Patrick Sports Academy s Director, Patrick Khanya, said it will recruit budding players from all over the country to be trained on various forms of sporting activities. We are going to train sports men and women as well as coaches and other trainers in the field of football, netball, handball, athletics, basketball, volleyball, and tennis, he explained, adding that the St Patrick facility is going to be the only sports training center of its kind in Tanzania. We are working to build and establish sporting venues in form of stadiums, courts and other playing fields, building hostels and ensuring that all necessary equipment get installed ready for serious work, maintained Khanya.The centre will also handle alternative forms of arts and sports such as Martial Arts (Karate and Taekwondo), Creative Arts (Music and Drama) as well as swimming, dancing and javelin.He said that, apart from the already existing playing fields that are part of the proposed center, the St Patrick Management has bought an additional 10 acres to ensure that each sport gets at least two playing fields, though others could have even more.But residents living in surrounding Olosiva and Kiranyi villages have stepped into the issue, demanding their rights to continue using the pathway cutting across the venue.The management has already tried to cut another path behind the venue but it seems they would rather stick to the old way claiming it was a customary route. We are worried that if people continue to cut across the field, it will be dangerous to pupils and students as well as other trainees using the pitch, said Khanya who once bought another piece of land so that the villagers could create another route there but without success.As for the Sports Academy recruits, the Saint Patrick Management intends to invest in youth aged from the tender age of 4 years, going up.Last year during the initial announcement of the academy, the Head of Sporting Department, Dennis Shemtoi added that, the center will bring together the youth from all the country as well as neighbouring states in order to ensure that the production remain the best all round. We are processing all the necessary permits from the government, registering all our sporting branches to their respective associations and ensuring that each stage of the sporting development for the youngsters is followed, said Shemtoi.Other than training, the St Patrick Academy will also be organizing and hosting a number of sporting activities at both local and international levels through which more talents can be recruited.
