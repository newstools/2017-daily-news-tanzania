Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam, yesterday, PSC Secretary, Mr Nyakimura Muhoji, said that out of the 48 appeals and three claims received between January and March 2017, only 13 appeals were granted. The Commission ordered that two appeals should start afresh consideration among the 13 appeals that were approved and one claim was rejected for being filed out of time, said Mr Muhoji.He observed that most of the filed appeals and claims are ruled out of time and for some no action has been taken something which is contrary to the requirement of the law. The required time for determining appeals and claims is 90 days after going through all the required processes which includes involvement of the claimant or appellant s response .The 60 days will be for gathering the evidence by the Investigation Committee and the remaining 30 days if for the ethics committee to take action contrary to that is a violation of the law, observed the Secretary.He further pointed out that any irresponsibility or carelessness may result in nullification of the appeal or claim and the person will be cleared from the case.
