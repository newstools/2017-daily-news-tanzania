Mr Kijuu expressed gratitude on Friday at the launch of the programme in Bukoba Municipality. Following the devastating earthquake that last year damaged properties, which belonged to farming communities: On behalf of the region s 2.8 million residents I thank FAO for the timely intervention, he said.According to Mr Kijuu, about 5,000 households in five councils namely Muleba, Kyerwa, Bukoba Rural, Misenyi, and Bukoba Municipality will benefit from the programme. He directed District Commissioners (DCs) and District Executive Directors (DEDs) to ensure close supervision of the programme in order to have value for money.He also directed the councils to set aside funds for buying seeds urging the people to plant fast maturing food crops including sweet potatoes, maize and cassava.FAO Country Representative, Mr Fred Kafeero, said that the programme followed a request made by the government through the Prime Minister s Office, which carried out an impact assessment following the September earthquake and a prolonged dry spell which happened in Kagera Region.He elaborated that the two year-programme would cost a total of 299,000 US dollars and would, among other things, scale-up good agricultural practices and other modern agriculture approaches in order to enhance productivity.It will also reduce the impact on climate related risks to farmers, protect the food and improve nutrition security of farmers as well as their livelihoods.The Tanzania Demographic Health Survey 2015/16 report revealed that stunting levels in Kagera Region stood at 41.7 per cent, Anaemia among children had reached 39.1 per cent, while Anaemia among women stands at 57.2 per cent.Persistent exposure of the affected households to inadequate food consumption could worsen the already vulnerable nutrition status of children.
