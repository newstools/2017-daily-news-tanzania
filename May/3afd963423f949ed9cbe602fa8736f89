Club founder, Azim Thakur, said during an event to present kit in Dar es Salaam on Thursday night that the sponsorship officially started early this year and that it is not the first time for the company to sponsor cricket.He said that the company s decision to extend the contract will depend on the side s performance in different competitions.As part of the agreement, Aces received new kits from SBC and according to Thakur, the team will start using the kits. The club s General Manager Sanam Mahambrey said that they had also handed the side new training kits three months ago. Today we are happy, because they have also promised to give us more support depending on our performance in competitions. If we perform well in such events like the Advanced Players League (APL), they will support our development programmes, said Thakur.He added that: We have many Tanzanian players in our squad. We sent one of our young players, Salum Jumbe, to Pakistan and South Africa for a training stint and he has improved a lot. The decision to establish Aces, Thakur revealed, aimed at improving the standard of cricket at domestic level, as well as grooming home grown players. Aces Club is made up of players of different nationalities and Thakur insisted that the outfit does not recruit players based on their communities. Aces are still a new side and we require a lot of assistance. A lot of companies are here to support us, but we also have to show our performance, he said. We are trying to improve our players with a lot of training and good facilities.We invest a lot in training, we had begun constructing a training ground in the city, but the project had to be put on hold because of technical issues, added Thakur. Pepsi have offered us the carpets and nets we need for the facility.Any corporate won t start straight away, they will take some time to increase support we will, eventually, get more sponsorship, he said.
