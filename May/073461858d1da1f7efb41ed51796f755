The advice was given by HelpAge International on Tuesday, during the launch of a report on the impacts and implications of gender mainstreaming in rural transport in the country.Its Country Director, Ms Amleset Tewords, said research conducted in Kilolo and Kibaha districts (in Iringa and Coast regions, respectively) pointed to that need.The research, focused on promoting safe and sustainable transport for rural communities, was funded by UK Aid and co-ordinated by the Africa Community Access Partnership (AsCAP).She said despite strong attention to gender in the Rural Travel and Transport Programme (RTT) and Local Government Transport Programme (LGTV), women lack a voice and participation in initial consultations due to a lack of self-confidence and society s prejudices. Their participation through direct employment in road construction projects is also limited. Only in Kilolo District was a case of gender equality in the Village Travel and Transport Programme (VTTP) project cited, she said.According to him, it is only the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) road projects that seem to have achieved benefits among marginalized women.Prevailing negative perceptions of women s ability to participate in construction work, given their family duties, were telling, he pointed out.
