The committee is currently at initial stages of coordinating and assessing people living closer to the national park because this issue has been a problem for a long time in the country that needs long-term solutions, he said.The Deputy Minister said the initial report of the committee had already been handed over to Permanent Secretaries (PSs) of the respective ministries, adding that the PSs would hand over the report to the Cabinet before the final directive from top government authorities.Eng Makani said the exercise that was taking place in Karagwe was just earmarking and putting new signs in the demarcations that have been existing for a long time but residents there are not able to identify them. However, he was quick to point out that the government would intervene to see if the concerns raised by the Karagwe lawmaker were valid.
