Tanzania s High Commissioner in the UK, Dr Asha-Rose Migiro, confirmed in an interview with Daily News that there is no report of any killed or injured Tanzanian in the assault, which has been blamed on a suicide attacker.As of today evening it had been confirmed that 22 people died, with 59 others injured in the explosions.Revelers were leaving the arena after a concert by US singer Ariana Grande when the explosion was heard.In a statement in Downing Street, the PM said it was "now beyond doubt that the people of Manchester and of this country have fallen victims to a callous terrorist attack" that targeted "defenseless young people".She said the security services believe they know the attacker's identity but are not yet able to confirm.She chaired the meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee and is expected to travel to Manchester later.It is the worst terrorist attack in the UK since the July 7 bombings in 2005 in which 52 people were killed.
