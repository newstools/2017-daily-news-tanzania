The Premier League is over. For now it important to keep our concentration about the upcoming Federation Cup final against Mbao, the Ugandan trainer said. Simba led the Mainland Premier League race for prolonged periods in the just ended campaign, opening an 8-point lead at one time, but could not wrestle the title from holders Yanga. It s disappointing for us we could not win the league title but we have another chance in the Federation Cup, we need to focus on it and make sure we win, Mayanja added.Simba will go into the final, due at the Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma, as favourites, however, Joseph Omog s right-hand man, Mayanja, is under no illusions about the scale of the task that lies ahead.The former Ugandan international recognizes that Mbao are on a fine form and riding high in confidence hav ing twice defeated Premier League champions, Young Africans. FA Cup matches are always tough and this will be no different. They are a good team and will be buoyed by this win (against Yanga), but we ll be ready for it, said Mayanja.Mbao reached their historic Federation Cup final aftoric Federation Cup final aftoric Federation Cup final af ter seeing off holders Young Africans 1-0 in the final match staged at the CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza last month.They replicated that feat against the Premier League champions on Saturday as they survived a drop in the last day of the campaign.
