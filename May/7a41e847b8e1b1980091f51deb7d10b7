The Deputy Minister, Prime Minister s Office, Labour, Youth, Employment and People with Disabilities, Mr Anthony Mavunde, made the revelation in Dar es Salaam yesterday, adding that the government has started implementing the programme in various parts of the country.Speaking at the launch of the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN) Tanzania, Mr Mavunde said that the network will strengthen the skills development of the youth, where about 27,000 of them are expected to be reached in this financial year.He said it is part of the government s plan to address unemployment of the youth countrywide. The Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN) Tanzania has been launched by the Association of Tanzania Employers (ATE) in partnership with Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN). The government is currently undertaking the five year programme on skills upgrading and one of the components is apprenticeship...thus, a network has been launched today (yesterday ) and will strengthen the government s initiatives to help majority of the youth to undergo various training and easily access the labour markets, he pointed out.He said the programme will also help the youth to acquire practical skills and experience to address challenges at workplaces, which has been negating their access to find jobs as a prerequisite, especially the young graduates coming out of learning institutions. Many young people, especially young graduates have been denied employment opportunities because they lack experience(s), but with this programme which includes workplace practical training and classroom theoretical training, they will be enabled to get direct employment, Mr Mavunde pointed out.He said according to a report by the Inter University Council for East Africa, 61 per cent of the regional graduates are ill prepared to acquire competitive jobs, thus making them unsuitable to acquire them. This is the biggest challenge to employers, because if they have to employ young graduates, they will be required to spend a lot of time and resources to train them, something this programme is going to address, he added. However, he said according to researches, there are criteria for a country to attain a middle income economy, citing skill being one of them.The deputy minister said in order to attain the middle income economy the country should have higher skills of about 12 per cent, medium 34 per cent and low 54 per cent. He called upon the youth in the country to utilise various opportunities in their midst including various youth empowerment programme which are ongoing around.ATE chairperson, Dr Aggrey Mlimuka, said that the apprenticeship programme will help employers to get skilled and experienced workers and minimise cost of training them. He said GAN Tanzania is dedicated to narrowing gaps in skills and strengthening the collaboration between the Tanzania business community, government and social partners.
