This is a special way of celebrating completion of 100 years of Humanitarian Services in Global Communities by Lions Clubs International, the largest Service Club in the world.It consists of more than 1.4 million members and 46,000 clubs spread out in more than 207 countries and geographical areas, he said .The President of the Lions Club of Dar es Salaam (Host), Lion Noreen Nathoo, said Tanzania Heart Babies Project 2017-2018, which has been in operation over the last three and a half decades, will be part of the highlights of the Lions Clubs International Centennial Anniversary Programme.It embraces partners who include Lions Club of Dar es Salaam (Host) and Regency Medical Centre. Others who are playing a significant role in the noble mission include Lions club all over the world, donors, corporate firms and foundations.Plus, hospitals in different parts of the world who can offer best subsidized rates or free surgeries. Lion Nathoo said over 3,000 children had been given a new lease of life, and stressed that efforts to raise funds for needlessly dying disadvantaged children and youth with heart problems would be sustained.
