The call by the institution s Acting Director General, Mr Tumaini Mtitu, coincided with World Metrology Day last Saturday.He remarked: TBS is facing an acute shortage of metrology staff. The problem can be tackled effectively through the introduction of a course in the field by local higher learning institutions. Mr Mtitu pointed out that, out of desperation, the few experts at the disposal of the standards regulatory outfit were overworked. He explained that, currently, only the College of Business Education (CBE) was offering the course.This was initially at Advanced Diploma level, and was subsequently upgraded to first degree status. CBE alone cannot cater for the increasing demand of experts in metrology; therefore we urge other higher learning institutions to think of market needs by introducing a course in the field, he pleaded.He added, moreover, that the bureau wasn t adequately empowered financially, to buy state-of- the-art equipment.The TBS executive furthermore explained that the infrastructure of the metrology laboratory was built way back in 1982. Tanzania is ranked fourth in Africa, on the certification standards front, the top three being Kenya, Egypt and South Africa.
