We are presently writing regulations and then register the chamber before July this year, he said adding we have put the Tanzanian Ambassador in China Mbelwa Kairuki, as board member because he is the one who advised us to form this chamber," he said.He said the purpose of establishing the chamber is to promote Tanzania-China business because many of its members were born in Tanzania and they are living in China knowing the circumstances of both countries to look at ways of empowering the country in investment and trade. We will also be a voice for traders of all sides in building relationships with relevant institutions to explain where they occur as investment challenge in identifying legitimate investors, wages for workers after investing with others to ensure every country benefit from investments and business, he said."In our unity, as well as an understanding of the various aspects of the technology required to support various sectors, agriculture into crops needed in China and they help find markets for traders, he said.But also collect Tanzanians in China to join together and turn in open areas of investment by using various technologies of China jointly rather than invest individually. But also to help the government to determine the true investors or are false by using the community that many of them are married and have families in China to find actual investors.Mr Merishani added that another aim of establishing the chamber is to help in various aspects including building relationships in the community that there is good interaction between the Tanzanian and Chinese in business. We will help offset misunderstandings due to cultural differences for many variations which are not commercial. But to cultural misunderstandings in our Union we will be providing education for Tanzanian businessmen who come to China for using various journals and conferences," he said.Speaking of sub standard goods to enter the country, Merishani said the period for these products in Tanzania has run out as citizens now know these products, therefore traders are losing market and now they have stopped importing.
