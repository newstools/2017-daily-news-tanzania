Investment into the envisaged sugar factory which starts with the introduction of sugar farming in Tarime District would begin this year, opening up opportunity for establishment of a meat factory later.Currently, the whole region has more than 400 various industries most of them small industries. He invited more local and foreign investors to turn up and invest in the region.In their reports through the regional press club, Mara journalists assured the RC that they would continue reporting stories that will help to promote investment on industries in the area. Dr Mlingwa congratulated the journalists and also assured them of continued cooperation.Earlier, the Mara Regional Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO) Manager Ms Frida Mungulu cited agriculture as a key area, where livestock products hold immense investment opportunities within the region and beyond. Mara has a large number of livestock let us all promote investment in the livestock sector and it s also important to showcase stories of the best performing available industries, she counseled.She also called for serious investment in the region s tourism sector.
