Giving their views after presentations from TASAF coordinators in the Islands, and all of them fresh from field visits, officers from USAID, UNI CEF, UNFPA, and UNDP showered praise on what they described as life-changing the work among poor families.Mr Muderis Abdulahi, Task team leader, TASAF, sums up the mood at the World Bank, saying: We are convinced with what we have heard and seen about the implementation of the programmes and their impact on the poor families, adding, we re happy with the achievements so far, as we see the beneficiaries of the programme happy (too). One can feel the impact of the programme when talking to the beneficiaries. Growth of the family income, increase of the individual activities [farming, livestock, and arts/crafts], construction of better houses, and children who were out of school back to classes, were among the achievements from TASAF-PSSN as witnessed in the visited areas.Mr Paul Van Ufford from UNICEF attributed the visible success to good planning and commitment among the programme management and the beneficiaries, suggesting discussions on how to expand to reach more families. However, the development partners appealed to the TASAF management to resolve some of the small challenges like delays in making payments, and that the problems, if unresolved, would tarnish the smooth implementation of the programme.The Tanzania Social Action Fund programme is currently supervised by the Zanzibar s Second VicePresident, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, who said, If the development partners are happy, we are more-contented. He said the PSSN has been changing the lives of many households enrolled under the programme, and that all the executives in his office would ensure that the objectives of TASAF were met and the achievements sustained.Mr LadisLaus Mwamanga, TASAF Executive Director, said key workers in the programme deserve enormous credit, as he also commend ed the families themselves who have had the courage to change and give their children a better chance in life.Main beneficiaries of TASAF III are poor and vulnerable households living under the basic need poverty line. These households benefit from a combination of three cash transfers: basic and variable transfers and cash transfer through participation in labour-intensive public works.
