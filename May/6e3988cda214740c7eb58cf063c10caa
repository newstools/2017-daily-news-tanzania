This surfaced at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court in Dar es Salaam yesterday when a prosecutor with the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Mr Maghela Ndimbo, was giving the status on outcome of the trial after the case file was sent to the DPP for further action. We are now working on the DPP s directives calling for further investigations on some areas he has pinpointed. We promised to work on them the soonest possible and refer back the file to him (DPP) for his final decision on the matter, he told Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba following which the prosecution asked for another mention date.The magistrate granted the prosecution s request, but insisted that the PCCB should work on the directives as soon as possible so that the accused persons could know their fate.He adjourned the case to June 5, for another mention. Lawyers say that three things could happen when the prosecution s case file is taken to the DPP. He may draw new charges for prosecution of accused persons depending on the presented evidence to him.Furthermore, the DPP could either enter a nolle prosequi certificate in favour of the accused persons if the evidence brought before him was insufficient to mount their prosecution, or return the case file to the investigative machinery with directives of carrying out further investigations on some aspects.Other accused persons in the case are: Kanji Muhamdo Mwinyijuma, a businessman and Emanuel Simforian Massawe, who is RAHCO Company Secretary.
