According to a stock broker who did not want to be mentioned, oversubscription of the government securities is a result of banks preference of risk free government securities over lending to borrowers.Banks are currently facing soaring non-performing loans levels which have affected their balance sheets and hampered lending to borrowers.Latest official data suggest the ratio of non-performing loans ratio to gross loans has increased from 6.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent with a score of banks accumulating a ratio of over 50 per cent as loan repayment default rate soared to record high.The industry benchmark for NPLs ratio is pegged at five per cent. Analysts say the problem is likely to have broader impact to banks, businesses and the economy in general as shrinking lending to businesses means starving the economy of the funds to drive growth.
