As it happens the total cash tally from gate collection has been counted at 6.2 million/-, described to be meagre earning when compared to the set target, with organizers as well as teams management smelling foul play, pointing accusing fingers at each other. Yanga managed to thrash AFC 3-0 at the match held in the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium.The match coordinator, Charles Mnyalu, who actually invited Yanga all the way from Dodoma, including paying the team s transport and accommodation here, cried that he spent 20 million/- for the trouble and the generated 6 million/- left a lot to be desired; This is not just loss, this is an insult, he shouted.He explained that, a total of 20,000 entry tickets were printed and each was to be sold at 10,000/- meaning the organizers had anticipated close to 200 million/-. However, Mnyalu who is also the AFC Chairman says the total tickets sold were just 5,000. And that was despite the fact that, the stadium looked full; Sheikh Amri Abeid can accommodate 12,000 people seated.Yet only 6.2 million/- was realized from the event. Mnyalu paid Yanga 20 million/- down-payment before the team came to Arusha and it was agreed that 60 per cent of the earnings from the game was also to be taken by Young Africans.But with measly earnings, stadium management, the team and AFC officials were caught at loggerheads each arguing vehemently on who exactly deserves a cut from the sum and who caused the loss and what should be done.Yanga has already boycotted the second match between them and Nyanza FC in Manyara Region, saying the cash strife has discouraged them from further venture here. Last March, when the rival Simba Sports Club came to Arusha, more than 81 million/- was collected from ticket sales when residents flocked to see the game between Simba and Madini Football Club of Arusha.That was the highest revenue gain record at the stadium in more than 40 years.The Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium with a capacity to take 12,000 spectators, was overflowed with people during the game, such that 14,056 soccer fans filled the area to an extent of having 2,000 spectators sitting on the grass after the stalls were filled to brim.
