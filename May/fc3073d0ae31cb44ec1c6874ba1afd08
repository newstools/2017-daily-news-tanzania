Water is a crucial commodity for living, we think that through granting the water well on behalf of the deceased little angels, we will have played our part in praying for them to go to heaven, WIPAHS Spokesperson Amina Mbaraka told the Daily News in Dar es Salaam during the special prayers for the fallen children whose demise shocked the nation.During the prayers in Dar es Salaam and Coast Region, thousands of mourners gathered. Ms Mbaraka noted that they expect to construct the water well within the three months, but they are still contemplating on the location. We will drill the well and donate it to people with serious shortage, we believe that the well will exist for a longtime, making a good memory of the lost children, she said, explaining that the prayers were organized because WIPAHS, as the organisation that advocates education to children, was touched by the children s deaths.Acting Education Officer in Kibaha, Mr Ramadhani Lawoga, called on the school owners to observe traffic laws when transporting students to avoid unnecessary accidents.One of the mourners who participated in the prayers, Ms Atwiya Adam Ahmed, said We join our fellow parents who lost their beloved ones in the accident, as parents we feel the same pain.
