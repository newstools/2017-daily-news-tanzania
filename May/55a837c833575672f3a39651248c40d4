The minister raised a red flag in the National Assembly ; barely four days after President John Magufuli issued the same warning to all public institutions during the May Day celebrations in Kilimanjaro Region.Mr Simbachawene said he had noted with concern that there were some District Executive Directors (DEDs) who have been transferring officials especially teachers without giving them transfer allowances.The minister said he had initially issued a directive to all DEDs even before the president s directive that all teachers who were transferred between January and March without pay be given their stipends by April 30, but some of them were still reluctant. My ministry will take immediate actions on all leaders who failed to honour the directive because the deadline is already gone, he said.Mr Simbachawene issued the warning following a supplementary question by Special Seats MP, Kemilembe Lwota (CCM) who said there were many public servants who had been transferred to other duty stations without requisite pay. Many public servants especially those who were transferred from Dar es Salaam to the designated capital of Dodoma are yet to be given their transfer payments. What is the government doing especially now when we have the president s directive that no cheque no transfer? she queried.The Deputy Minister in the President s Office, (Regional Administration and Local Government), Selemani Jaffo said many of the officials had been paid their dues and that the government was keen on making sure that all the transfer debts were cleared.At Ushirika Stadium in Kilimanjaro region on Monday, Dr Magufuli said he would make improvements in the civil service in the next financial year, among them, employee transfer benefits which in some cases take too long to be settled, causing a lot of inconveniences to workers who move to new work stations.But that will be history come July, the president pledged, noting that all civil servants being transferred to new work stations will now be handed their letters of transfer alongside their pay cheques. In our next cabinet meeting that is what we are going to discuss your welfare, he said and added: All key people to see that happen; including the Vice President and Prime Minister are both here. Also, he said there would be no dilly-dallying when it comes to promotion of workers who qualify for promotions.
