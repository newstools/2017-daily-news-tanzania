The Minister of State, in the Prime Minister s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs Labour, Employment, Youths and the Disabled), Jenista Mhagama said in the National Assembly that there were no plans whatsoever to disband the Uhuru Torch Race.As Ms Mhagama gave the government s stance, Mgogoni Member of Parliament (MP), Dr Suleiman Ally Yusuph (CUF) said racing the Uhuru Torch countrywide was more or less the same as fire prayers, adding that Tanzanians were being forced to believe in those prayers.It all begun with Konde MP, Mr Khatib Said Haji (CUF) who wanted to know when the government would stop the Uhuru Torch Race, insisting that he didn t see any sense to have the budget for the same.However, Ms Mhagama said the government would continue embracing the Uhuru Torch as it was the national symbol that ought to be inculcated into one generation to the other. The major essence of our torch is to lighten even outside our boundaries as the agent of peace resolutions, unity, tranquility to be emulated in the African continent and the world at large, she added.The minister said other benefits of the old national symbol were to strengthen the union as well as implementing several development projects that have witnessed the laying of foundation stones as well as preaching patriotism and self giving to the nation.Ms Mhagama said in 2015 for example the projects that were launched by laying a foundation stone were 1,342 valued at 4,635bn/-.In his supplementary question, Mr Haji said the Uhuru Torch was instead of preaching peace and love for the nation, it was rather sowing seeds of discord.He asked the government to stop the Uhuru Torch race in Zanzibar as it was not falling within the matters of union.But, Ms Mhagama said the minor discrepancies were not enough to build an argument for suspension of the Uhuru Torch race, insisting that the government was looking on proper ways of seeking for solutions to the discrepancies.In yet another move, Nkasi MP Ally Keissy (CCM) asked the minister to state the cost of the Uhuru Torch race each year charging: I understand that when President John Magufuli banned District and Regional Commissioners to travel for the Uhuru Torch race climax, 6bn/- was saved but I want to know how much does the race cost per year.However, Ms Mhagama said in her response that the cost is determined by district councils asking the MP to consult them.
