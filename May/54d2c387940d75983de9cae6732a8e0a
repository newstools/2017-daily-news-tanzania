The Deputy Minister with the Health, Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children, Mr Hamisi Kigwangalla, has said that the government will assign specialist medical doctors in each methadone clinic.He was responding to a question from Mr Khatibu Said Haji (Konde -- CUF) who demanded to know what plans the government has to increase the number of specialist medical doctors to treat narcotic drug victims.Mr Khatibu further wanted to know whether the government has laid down strategies to curb smuggling of narcotic drugs into the country.His inquiry attracted an elaborate explanation from a minister in the Prime Minister's Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youths and the Disabled), Ms Jenista Mhagama.Ms Mhagama said that the Commissioner General of the Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA) had already prepared a strategic plan for fighting narcotic drug trafficking into the country. She noted that the crafting of the strategic plans involved experts from Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar.Meanwhile, she told Parliament that the Prime Minister's Office has allocated funds from its budget to support Non-governmental organizations that struggle to treat victims affected by narcotic drugs.The decision came after the Prime Ministers Office had recognized the role of the private sector in addressing the problem in the country.Earlier, Ms Mgeni Kadika (Special Seats -- CUF) sought to know the governments plan to offer free medical treatment to drug-affected youths, who are the future manpower for the country.Dr Kigwangala told the lawmakers that the government has continued providing medical treatment to narcotic drug victims at different public centres.Recently, the ministry opened new clinics at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Mwananyamala and Temeke Referral Hospitals in Dar es Salaam region.These centres have so far served at least 3,000 victims who get methadone. The expansion of the methadone services in those areas will be coupled with opening of centres in other regions such as Mwanza and Mbeya followed by Arusha, Tanga, and Coast.
