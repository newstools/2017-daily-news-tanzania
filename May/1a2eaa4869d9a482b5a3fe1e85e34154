Ambassador Iddi said the country needs competent professionals, capable of competing in the labour market as well as creating jobs for others.In a speech read on his behalf by Minister for Education and Trainings Riziki Pembe Juma at the launch of Kinduni Community Centre, the Vice- President reminded the centre management to hire professional instructors to convince parents to register their children for vocational trainings. Wananchi always look for better services, you better employ professional teachers who will not only be trusted by parents but also will help to sharpen skills of the students and produce qualified professionals in the current competitive job market, he said in his the speech.The vocational trainings centre, which is a brainchild of Kaskazini 'B' retired police officers, aims at easing unemployment among youths in the islands by offering computer course, agriculture, livestock keeping, tailoring and defense skills.Ambassador Iddi said most of vocational training projects failed to develop and reach their mission due to poor management and double- dealing, among others, challenging the retired servicemen to ensure their centre set an example in terms of resource management.He applauded the retired police officers for their move to establish the centre, calling on other retirees to come up with projects that will help youths and assist in the nation's economic growth.The Centre Director, Mr Shabaan Mohamed Iddi said the institution has recorded many achievements since it was established in 1992.He pleaded for more supports from the government and other development partners, saying the centre still faces many challenges, including shortages of sewing machines, erratic electricity supply and shortage of office furniture.Ms Riziki, on behalf of the Second-Vice-President, presented five sewing machines to support the centre.
