They therefore asked the government to take urgent remedial actions in order to address the situation which is getting out of control.In his question, (read on his behalf by Mr Saddiq Murrad-Mvomero CCM) Ulanga legislator Mr Goodluck Mlinga who questioned on measures taken by the government to control such situation in his constituency.He added that such animals were wreaking havoc in Ruaha, Chilombola, Ilonga and Ketaketa wards and Lukande and Lupilo parks. The Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Prof Jumanne Maghembe admitted that there was such problem in the aforementioned areas.He said that the government was taking various measures such as conducting frequent patrols and conducting education on best practices of conservation and self-defense against such animals. We also reduce severity of the animal s impact by using beehives, spilling dirty oil and pepper farming around farms he explained. Mr Murrad also claimed that such situation was also experienced in his constituency, asking the government to increase the number of wildlife wardens. I visited Mvomero and witnessed the situation, therefore my ministry will increase the number of wardens and equipment in the area and we ll cooperate with the district council so as to tackle such challenge, the minister replied.Mr Mbaruku Dau (Mafia) also lamented on the same, specifically asking the ministry to allow wananchi in his constituency to kill hippos and use them as food.Responding to such plea, the minister promised to send a team of experts to conduct a census of hippos and their impact before allowing wananchi to feast on the animals.Ms Esther Bulaya (Bunda-Chadema) also complained on the same problem, saying such invasion had caused famine. We ll beef up patrols in Bunda and Serengeti and we ll talk with development partners to see if we can erect a 140km fence, as a trial, to prevent such animals from entering the farms replied Prof Maghembe.
