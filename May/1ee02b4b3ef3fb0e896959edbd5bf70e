According to the Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr William Lukuvi, the plots were part of a scam pitting officials of the just-dissolved Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Dodoma local governance authorities all spanning 60,000 pieces of surveyed land.Upon this revelation, Mr Lukuvi told the National Assembly yesterday that, effective July1, 2017, his ministry would undertake fullscale identification of all those undeveloped surveyed lands. We will carry out a verification exercise during which we shall repossess and release them to the market so that members of the public could buy, he told the august House when tabling the ministry s 70.7bn/- budget for FY 2017/18.He noted that the verification exercise would go alongside issuance of the title deeds to the land owners in the region, allowing them to own the land for at least 99 years, in stark contrast to the ground lease given by the CDA which provided ownership of the land for only 33 years. This will enhance the investment in the designated capital of Dodoma and enable the landlords accessing loans from the financial institutions which regarded the ground lease as collateral with less security, he said.Mr Lukuvi gave assurances that the exercise would protect all ownership rights for those who bought their plots from the CDA, whose activities were transferred to the Dodoma Municipal Council soon after it was disbanded.Back to the Bills, they include the Real Estate Regulatory Authority Bill and the Real Estate Agent Bill and Land Repossession and Compensation, both of which seek to regulate the sector.Mr Lukuvi said the ministry arrived at the decision of crafting the Bill against the backdrop of a long-overdue request from stakeholders.The Bills, once enacted, will control people possessing the big chunk of lands without title deeds, a situation that had been denying the government an income from the capital gain. According to the law, one starts paying the capital gain immediately after the one acquires the title deed.He noted that most of the real estate agents hold thousands of acres of undeveloped land for years without the title deeds. According to Mr Lukuvi, current laws provide loopholes that allow few individuals to possess large chunks of lands at the expense majority of Tanzanians without lands. Recently, I went to Lindi region and found out that there was one person owning 4,000 acres of land so I decided to revoke his ownership, he told the National Assembly.He insisted that his ministry would ensure that the owners of the undeveloped lands pay tax and develop them, or those lands will be nationalized.
