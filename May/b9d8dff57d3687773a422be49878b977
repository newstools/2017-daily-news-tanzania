Secretary of the Yanga branch in Arusha, Dietrich Kateule said after the match against AFC, the champions will travel to Manyara for yet another friendly match.He said the team takes a breather today with a visit to the Mirerani Mining Hills of Simanjiro. AFC Arusha Chairman Charles Mnyalu said that Yanga s visit and related matches are part of the events to commemorate the 23rd Anniversary of the AFC, a team which was formed back in 1994 here. We invited and actually expected many teams to take part in the celebrations but it seems a number of them could not make it, mostly due to financial constraints backed with lack or sponsors, said the AFC chairman.Apparently the planned 23rd AFC Anniversary Bonanza had to be shelved and the team will just play against Yanga as efforts are being put in place to ensure that in few weeks time the sporting bonanza can be organized again. We have enlisted 40 players who are in camp, ready to face Yanga, but most important, to be in better position for the Second Division League (SDL) so that the AFC can restore its lost glory, said the team official.Yanga s trip to Arusha follows in the footstep of their arch-rivals, Simba SC, which a few weeks ago also came to Arusha and played against Madini FC. Simba won 1-0.
