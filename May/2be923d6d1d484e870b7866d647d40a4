He was speaking at the weekend, in the light of selfish people profiting from items donated from American benefactors, which had been channelled through the Tanzania Acts of God Church (TAGC).Rev Ikongo explained that, his ministry had gone to great lengths to lobby potential donors, who eventually delivered a wide range of items for easing the plight of, and cheering up needy individuals.He lamented, however, that some unscrupulous people to whom they had entrusted them for distribution to the needy, sold them instead.The cleric said the items sold for between 200,000/- and 400,000/- per item, adding that, the perpetrators wouldn t go unpunished.It was highly immoral, he pointed out, to sell items to the would-be beneficiaries, who were financially hard up. The culprits must repent, considering that, the items were meant to be dished out free of charge through the agency of the church, he remarked.
