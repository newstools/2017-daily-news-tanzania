During the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers in Arusha, Tanzania, the bloc s Secretary General, Ambassador Lib rat Mfumukeko, submitted a budget proposal for financial year 2017/18 amounting to 113.8 million US dollars compared to the current budget of 101.4 million US dollars. Owing to the current economic situation, all partner states are experiencing rationalisation of their national budgets and, therefore, it would be difficult to increase contributions to the EAC Budget, reads a report of the central decision-making organ of the Community. The meeting, therefore, agreed to a zero per cent increase in partner states contributions to the 2017/18 Budget, The Council observed that although there is no increase in the individual partner states contribution, countries total contribution will increase after including contribution from the Community s new member, South Sudan.From May 22 to June 3, the final sitting of the third East African Legislative Assembly (EALA), in Arusha, Tanzania, will mainly debate the budget estimates as adopted by the Council.MP Patricia Hajabakiga, chairperson of EALA Rwanda Chapter, told The New Times that nothing much is likely to change. Of course the budget voted by EALA cannot go beyond the ceiling provided by the partner states.It is only rationalising within what is already available, Hajabakiga said. In case some institution needs something and maybe some other institution has excess then they will rationalise within the available envelope.What the council has approved will be the next EAC budget, she said last week. The Council s report shows that 52 per cent (57.3 million US dollars) of the bloc s next budget will come from internal resources, mainly partner states contributions, which were set at 54 per cent previously. Development partners provide the rest.To fund activities of key organs of the bloc including the Secretariat, the Assembly, and the East African Court of Justice for the next financial year, each partner state is expected to contribute 8.3 million US dollars, a slight decrease from past years when each country was required to contribute 8.3 million US dollars.Support from development partners for financial year 2017/18 is set at 52.8 million US dollars against the current year s 46.7 million US dollars, an increase of 13 per cent. Internal resources, however, remain constrained especially as countries have been failing to make their obligatory remittances to a Secretariat on time.The Council s report indicates that the bloc s 2016/17 budget included drawings from the EAC General Reserve Fund to the tune of 6.3 million US dollars. The Secretariat is experiencing challenges facilitating activities as some funds for the previous financial year are yet to be paid.Therefore, the Reserve Account has a nil balance, hence no funding for the Financial Year 2017/18 budget could be included in the Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), according to the report. While in Kigali in March, regional MPs passed a resolution urging the Council of Ministers to find a common stance on countries funding deficit.They heaped blame on the Council for not doing enough to ensure member states meet their financial obligations. As at March 31, the Council reported that the status of partner states budgetary contributions for Financial Year 2016/17 had changed, with Kenya having fully paid and Uganda paying 91.5 per cent, while Rwanda reached 64.2 per cent and Tanzania 30.5 per cent.Among other arrears, Burundi had not cleared 771,037 US dollars from the financial year 2015/16. Presently, the ministers of finance are meeting in Arusha to iron out various matters regarding the bloc s finances, and especially the issue regarding the sustainable financing mechanism for the bloc.
