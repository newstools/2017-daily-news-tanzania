Chairperson of the EAC Council of Ministers and Minister of East African Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, Dr Ali Kirunda Kivenjija, said the budget estimates are presented at a time when the integration process is gathering momentum and the EAC membership having expanded to six partner States, following approval of Southern Sudan application.Dr Kivenjija, who is also Second Deputy Prime Minister of Uganda, noted that the new financial year brings aboard a new important programme at Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC), with an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) programme.The estimates were tabled on Thursday evening here by the Deputy Minister of East African Cooperation of the Republic of Uganda, Mr Julius Maganda. It mainly aims to develop IWRM model for lake Victoria Basin, facilitating the preparation of bankable IWRM projects and promote adherence to harmonised water resources management policies, laws and management instruments.It is supported by Republic of Germany and the European Commission. The key strategic interventions envisaged in the next financial year include the establishment and operationalisation of the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Mwanza, production of charts in Lake Victoria, supply and installation of aids to navigation and the operationalisation of oil spill/toxic chemicals contingency plan for Lake Victoria, he said.The budget proposal is up from 101million US dollars for the 2016/17 financial year, whose implementation, as of March 2017, the Council of Ministers had ensured that the resources were put to effective use.Its performance stood at 65 per cent for activities funded by partner States and 31 per cent for development partners.Proposals of allocation of the budget to organs and institutions of the EAC see the EAC Secretariat getting 60,183,201 US dollars; EALA 17,996,959 US dollars, East African Court of Justice 4,140,166 US dollars, LVBC 11,960,643 US dollars and Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation 2,466,655 US dollars.Further allocations are to the effect that The Inter University Council of East Africa is set to get 6,766,928 US dollars, East African Science &amp; Technology Commission 1,500,164 US dollars, East African Kiswahili Commission 1,553,098 US dollars, East African Health Research Commission 2,225,324 US dollars while East African Competition Authority would see itself off with 1,337,045 US dollars.Dr Kivenjija said the budget will be financed from six sources: Ministries of EAC Affairs (50,226,522 US dollars), ministries responsible for education (4,848,431 US dollars), ministries responsible for fisheries (1,549,254 US dollars), member universities (303,435 US dollars), development partners (52,868,638 US dollars) while miscellaneous revenue will be 333,903 US dollars.The Council Chair said budget assumptions are that there will be continued and consolidated political support for the EAC integration; availability of adequate financial support from development partners as well as political stability and good governance.EALA members, under Speaker Dan Kidega, heard that other assumptions are that there will be safe and stable security across the region, conducive macro-economic and business environment in the region and global economic stability.Mr Kivenjija noted that some key anticipated challenges during implementation of the Community programmes include persistent delays in remittance of funds from partner States and development partners; limited financial resources occasioned by reduced support from development partners.Here, the budget is declining while demand is on the increase. The Minister outlined other key challenges as delayed harmonisation of national laws that impact on the implementation of the EAC Common Market Protocol and understaffing that is seriously impacting on effectiveness and efficiency in the implementation of projects and programmes.Dr Kivenjija highlighted strategies for mitigating the challenges as close follow-up of remittances by partner States and development partners and continuous dialogue with development partners to support the EAC projects and programmes.The EAC will also engage in awareness creation among partner States on provision of various protocols for EAC integration and implementation of the Institutional Review, as per the directives of the 17th Summit Heads of States. Discussion of the estimates is to start early next week.
