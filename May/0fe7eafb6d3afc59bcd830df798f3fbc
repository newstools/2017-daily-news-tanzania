Speaking during special prayers for the country s peace and security, the Second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi denounced the price hiking, saying the move is also against Islamic teachings.Traditionally, Muslim faithful observe the holy month by fasting during day hours and breaking the fast with large meals in evening, the opportunity some traders capitalise on to mint money. We only have few weeks before the Holy Month of Ramadhan begins. There is a tendency of some dishonest traders using the month to increase prices of basic consumables.The government is watching the food prices and stern measures will be instituted against anyone behind artificial increase in food prices without any genuine reasons, he warned.According to him, soaring of food prices will compel low income families to trim on the Ramadhan feasts, advising traders to consider the less privileged citizens as well. Ambassador Iddi however assured the availability of all the requisite and essential commodities to people during the Holy Month.The Muslim Community organised event in the isles was also attended by religious leaders, including Tanzania Chief Mufti Abubakary bin Zubeiry, government officials and other believers.Ambassador Iddi also appreciated the solidarity of Zanzibaris especially during the current heavy rains that have affected people, damaged infrastructures and rendered hundreds of residents homeless. We put our differences aside and helped each other when disasters strikes us, this is a good sign, we need to be together and put aside our political and other differences, he said, urging citizens to protect and preserve the national peace and security and called on all religious leaders to continue praying for the country s peace and security.
