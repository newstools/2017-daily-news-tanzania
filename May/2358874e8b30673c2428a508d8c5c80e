She said the vehicles and other movable property were seized during an ongoing crackdown on tax defaulters, carried out in collaboration with TRA.Yono, who are the official auctioneers, debt collectors and commission agents were contracted by the tax watchdog to collect overdue debts. I request all Tanzanians to support the efforts by President John Magufuli to bring development to the country by ensuring that all people are paying taxes so that social services can be availed to all, she said.Ms Kevela stated the firm also managed various goods which were sold without being supported by Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs) receipts. We are firm and strong and we want to give assurance that we shall descend on all people who have failed to honour their tax obligations, she said, further advised Tanzanians to pay taxes voluntarily instead of waiting for unnecessary operations.Ms Kevela says her company was contracted by TRA to collect debts in Dar es Salaam, Coast, Njombe, Mbeya, Iringa regions on the Mainland, and in Zanzibar as well.
