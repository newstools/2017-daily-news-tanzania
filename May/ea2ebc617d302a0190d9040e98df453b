The breeders, across the globe, aimed at developing hybrid banana varieties with 30 per cent higher yields and a 50 per cent increase in diseases resistance compared to the current varieties.However, breeders warned that developing such hybrids which have least resistance to three major pests and diseases may take up to 20 years before releases to farmers.The breeder team has already spent three years on research. International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Banana Breeder, Prof Rony Swennen, said at the end of five years they want to deliver hybrid bananas that also meet the needs and preferences of the end-user. We are ahead of our main target as currently we have already developed 48 matoke hybrids which are headed for preliminary yield trials and we have many more in the pipeline, Prof Swennen, who is the project s Team Leader, said in a release.The project is focusing on matoke and mshale, the two most popular East African Highland cooking banana types in Uganda and Tanzania, respectively.Also, the project focuses on the two major diseases attacking the crop Fusarium Wilt and Black Leaf Streak diseases Sigatoka disease, and two major pests parasitic nematodes (microscopic worms) and weevils.The hybrids are one of the key achievements of a five-year, multi-partnership initiative to deliver improved varieties of cooking bananas to smallholder farmers in Uganda and Tanzania. This was one of the accomplishments reported by the team at its third annual planning and review meeting held recently in Kampala, Uganda.The project brings together experts from banana breeding programs across the globe including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, India, Kenya, Malaysia, South Africa, Sweden and the USA to work with the teams in Tanzania and Uganda.It is led by IITA and funded by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Also speaking at the meeting, the IITA Director for Eastern Africa, Victor Manyong, noted that banana was not only a major food crop for smallholders but also a major commodity. Therefore, any efforts to increase the crop s production would also translate into an improvement of their livelihoods, Mr Manyong, who is stationed in Dar, said.It is estimated that Tanzania produces about 3.7 million metric tonnes annually on 403,000 hectares. Kilimanjaro producing mshale and Kagera matoke are the most famous banana growing regions, which jointly produce about 2.5 million metric tonnes annually.Bananas are sterile with very low seed sets making them very difficult to breed. Researchers have to force them to develop seeds for crossing and developing varieties.
