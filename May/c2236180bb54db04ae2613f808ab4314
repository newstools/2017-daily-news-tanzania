This is the first conviction of people whom the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner (RC), Paul Makonda, named early this year as dealers in abusive drugs.Principal Resident Magistrate at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court Huruma Shaidi convicted Nasher, a reportedly car dealer at Mikocheni suburb, on his own plea of guilty on possession of small quantity of narcotic drugs and two counts relating to drug consumption.The drugs involved in the matter were heroin hydrochloride, diacetylmorphine and exazepam. Initially, the accused denied the charges against him, but in yesterday s proceedings, he requested the prosecution to re-read the charges. He then changed his plea.The court had no other option but to convict him on all counts. Having considered the advanced mitigation factors, the magistrate sentenced the accused to pay 500,000/- fine or go to jail for three years on each count.The magistrate ordered the jail term to run concurrently. Before the sentence, the convict pleaded for leniency, saying he has family responsibilities, including taking care of his ailing father and it was his first conviction on criminal offence.He further beseeched the court to have mercy on him because by admitting to the charges, he had saved the court s time and inconveniences in trying the case and that he had spent time in sobre houses, helping him to quit drugs abuse.The prosecution led by State Attorneys Mwana-Amina Komba Kono and Edith Mauye had requested the court to punish the convict in accordance with the law, considering the seriousness of the committed offence to serve as a lesson to other people engaged in the same crimes.It was alleged that on February 15, this year, at Victoria Plaza Building in Kinondoni District in the city, the convict was found in possession of Heroin Hydrochloride weighing 0.49grams. The court heard further that on the same day, the businessman consumed diacetylmorphine and exazepam.
