Home Affairs Minister, Mr Mwigulu Nchemba told parliamentarians here that the vehicles will arrive into the country this year, an addition to 72 others which were recently distributed to police stations across the country.Special Seats MP, Ms Rhoda Kuchela (Chadema) voiced concern that the police was facing serious shortage of police stations, with few vehicles for patrols and worse still there is no fuel to facilitate operations. What is the government s plan to increase fuel allocation to police stations and facilitate patrols, she asked. Without giving further details, Mr Nchemba said the government has increased budget allocation to the police to buy fuel.He said that in a bid to advance against increased security concern, the police are expected to receive 200 more special patrol cars, this year.On construction of police posts, the Minister said the government had suspended new construction works to pave the way for evaluation and payment of unsettled arrears. He admitted that there are contractors who had done a good job, yet they have not been paid. The government will pay all the contractors soon after the evaluation process. He detailed that the evaluation is being carried out to verify the exact amount not paid and legitimate claims.House of Representative Mr Jaku Ayoub told the National Assembly that one of the contractors under Al Batna Building Co Ltd built Mkokotoni and Madungu police posts in Zanzibar at a cost of 223.44m/-. The government had not paid this contractor despite completing construction work in 2012.
