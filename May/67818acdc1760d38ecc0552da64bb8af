Dr Ulisubya said Ebola, which had initially struck the West African region, spread to North-East Uele in the Central African Republic (CAR), and subsequently to DRC. He said experts in Tanzania s team that will soon embark on the educative mission, were part of a larger group that had been on an experience-acquiring experience in West Africa.The PS pointed out that, although not a single person in Tanzania had been reported to have been infected by the disease, state had to be on full alert and take precautions.He said since human interaction was one of the agencies for swift infection, people in Tanzania, especially those bordering DRC, should be extra cautious.
