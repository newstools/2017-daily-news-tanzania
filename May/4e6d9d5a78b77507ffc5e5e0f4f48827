Last year, the organization, which was founded by billionaire Andrew Goodall, dished out 2.9bn/- for the same cause, pointing out that supporting the sector would ultimately be reflected in economic advancement. It is our dream to make Tanzania a great nation in the development arena in the African continent, given its vast natural resources, the magnate told a news conference here yesterday.The British mogul, whose investments are spread across many countries worldwide, expressed great admiration for Tanzania, which propelled him to support the country. Tanzanians are very bright people and have a wide understanding of issues.They have been endowed with vast resources, and it thus beats my mind why the country is still underdeveloped, he remarked, adding; I hence believe that investment in education will enable the country uplift its economy. I am just asking for co-operation from responsible stakeholders. Choosing to invest in primary education to start with, the billionaire is upbeat that nurturing pupils with quality education in early stages will produce best students in secondary and ultimately in higher learning institutions.The visiting philanthropist is today scheduled to meet with the Minister for Education, Science, Vocational Training, Science and Technology, Prof. Joyce Ndalichako, in Dodoma and thereafter, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa.Before meeting the two leaders, he plans to meet the Ngorongoro MP, who is also the Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Mr William Ole Nasha.The foundation has been supporting schools in the constituency.Mr Goodall was however categorical that challenges facing Tanzanians would be tackled by Tanzanians.
