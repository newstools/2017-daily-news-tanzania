The move has been prompted by reports that the incompetence of some of the officers was behind poor performance in the council for many years.Speaking at the climax of the district s tour, the RC said thorough audit of staff performance was a prelude to ensuring that, only competent staff were retained to steer the district forward.Mr Mongela pointed out that the tendency of some officers being stuck in one station for several years without being transferred up to 30 in some cases compromised efficiency. We must find new ways of serving the people better, and one of the moves towards attaining that goal is to offload some employees, he said emphatically.The RC ordered the immediate arrest of two officials in Ukara Island for questioning in connection with allegations of misappropriating 17m/- that had been allocated for the construction of a primary court building some five years ago.He suspended staff leave for May, June and July, for them to participate in a collective servicedelivery enhancement scheme to be supervised by the District Commissioner, Mr Estomih Chang a, and the District Executive Director, Mr Frank Bahati.Mr Mongela who also directed that officials who swindled cash allocated for the construction of a residential house for Bwisya primary court be booked -- will make a follow-up tour in August.Meanwhile, the Ukerewe District Council is facing a shortage of 6,136 desks for various primary schools. According to Mr Bahati, 11,489 desks had been distributed, the shortfall being occasioned by increased in enrollment in many schools.Some of the stakeholders that are chipping in the Tanzania Forests Services (TFS) which donated 400 desks at the weekend. The data we have shows that the enrollment rose from 102,114 in 2016 to 107,481 this year, the DED explained.
