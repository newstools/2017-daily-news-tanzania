He said yet to be identified source of fire burnt the couple while sharing a house they were renting in Manguruwe section of Kiranyi Ward. He further said the strange part of the scene was that the rented building, with five other tenants living there, belongs to Ms Antuja Msuya, who happens to be the blood sister of the late Mr Erasto Msuya, the mining tycoon who was shot dead along Arusha-Moshi Highway, four years ago.It was said the late Msuya, also lost his other sister, the later Annette Msuya who was butchered at her home in Dares- salaam last year.Regional Police Commander, Mr Charles Mkumbo confirmed the report of the mysterious deaths, but declined to admit the identities of the two victims.Unverified source said that when the neighbours saw fumes of smoke bellowing out of the house at about 9.00 am, yesterday morning, they were surprised that the house door was locked from outside, though it was clear that some people were inside.It was unclear how the couple was consumed in the fire with their mattress and other beddings remaining untouched by the fire.Neighbours and tenants at the building said the room in which the couple died, was being occupied by a young lady, who only used to come there at night and leave very early in the morning and they hardly knew her.A local leader who could only be named as Mr Chami said they suspect that one of the two victims could have been the landlady, unless she will resurface to clear the doubt. An angel of death must be patrolling the area; it is only five days ago, when a man hanged himself around here. But previously also, floods killed a hotel chef when the house he was sleeping in was swept by water, added Mr Chami.
