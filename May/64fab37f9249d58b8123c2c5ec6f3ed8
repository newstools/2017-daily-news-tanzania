The government told the National Assembly that the money, which was collected from October 2013 to February 2017, was shared between the treasury and Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH).The Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Engineer Edwin Ngonyani, said that out of it 56 billion/- went to the treasury and the remaining 6bn/- was channeled to COSTECH for financing various researches. The researches are for national benefit and before the establishment of TTMS such revenue could not be obtained, he said. His statement came after a question by Kigamboni lawmaker, Dr Faustine Ndugulile (CCM) who asked for updates on operations of the TTMS since installation and amount collected so far.The TTMS, which was installed in 2013, is implemented by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). The system provides the authority with technological solutions required to measure and analyze key aspects of the sector in an independent way, with a view of ensuring both regulatory compliance and the exhaustive collection of levies by the State.Eng Ngonyani said that the government will continue building capacity among experts at TCRA, for the organisation to keep up with technological advancement in the world.Meanwhile, Busega MP Raphael Chegeni (CCM) also wanted to know when the government will start controlling mobile phone charges, following complaints from phone users that the mobile phone companies have been overcharging them.Eng Ngonyani said the work to install the Revenue Assurance system was ongoing, arguing that the system will monitor all mobile telephone companies in the country.
