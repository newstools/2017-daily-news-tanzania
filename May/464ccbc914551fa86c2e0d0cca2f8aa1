The plan comes just a day after the National Assembly approved over 1.1trn/-, the highest-ever budget for the Ministry of Health, for the 2017/18 financial year.The Vice-President, Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan, announced here yesterday that the government is aiming to double the number of public health facilities and provide maternal health care at 50 per cent up from 24 per cent. This means that nearly 300 out of 473 public health facilities across the country will be equipped with a blood bank, maternity ward as well as a fully-equipped theatre, the VP said at the climax of International Day of the Midwife, in Dodoma.The move is set to increase the number of expecting mothers attending antenatal clinic to 70 per cent up from 51 per cent, come 2020.Apparently, the government strategically allocated 30bn/- in the next financial year to increase the number of blood banks, equipment and medicines needed in maternal health and boost family planning campaigns. At least 556 women die in every 100,000 live births, a number that rose from 432.According to the Vice- President, such deaths can be avoided should midwives execute professionalism and commit to serving lives. From now onwards, all midwives who will recklessly lead to loss of life will face the wrath of the law. In case of professional faults, such cases will be handled by the council governing the sector, she said. There are a number of concerns levelled against some health service providers to do with unethical conduct this will no longer be tolerated. The White Ribbon Alliance and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) equally voiced concern over the rising maternal mortality in the country.WRA National Coordinator, Ms Rose Mlay, said since 1996, there have not been enormous strides in reducing the number of women dying during or after delivery.Dr Hashina Begum, UNFPA Country Representative added: Tanzania is among 83 countries classified by WHO, for failing to meet the recommended density of HRH requirement to ensure skilled attendance at birth (22.8 per 10,000 populations) No single region in the country that meets this requirement. However, Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ummy Mwalimu announced that the government apart from increasing the budget, will this year employ more health professionals to reduce the gap.
