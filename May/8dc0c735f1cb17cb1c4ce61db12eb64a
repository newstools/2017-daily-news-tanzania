The Head of State said that the government will not hesitate to scrap the tax relief it imposed on food items during the holy month if traders will abuse the opportunity. The intention by the government to offer tax relief on food items during Ramadhan is to make sure that all citizens afford it and break their fast, but there are dishonest traders who don t want to reduce prices, thus we will be forced to scrap the tax relief, Dr Shein warned.Muslims around the world are expected to observe the Holy Month of Ramadhan next week depending on the sighting of the moon. In another development, Dr Shein called upon the business community within and outside the country to provide support to families affected by recent heavy rains in Zanzibar.Dr Shein was receiving 10m/-, 100 litres of cooking oil and four trucks of food items including rice, sugar and wheat flour from renowned businessman, Mr Mohamed Raza, who was accompanied by other businessmen: Saidi bopar, Mohammed Radha and Ahmada Abdlwakil.The heavy down pour that hit the isles for the past three weeks, according to the President, left hundreds of residents homeless adding that the government has carried out a number of initiatives to restore damaged infrastructure and they are currently carrying out assessment. After the evaluation report, the government is looking forward to improve infrastructure including digging out drainage systems alongside roads and working on committee recommendations to reduce tragedies during heavy rains. I had the chance to visit victims and their situation was not good, that is why I appealed to the business community and other people to support these families where they can. I would like to call upon other business people and well-wishers to continue providing their support, he appealed. On the other hand, Mr Raza urged the Diaspora community and other businesspeople in Zanzibar and Tanzania mainland, to support the affected families, reminding them to ask themselves what they did to the country.
