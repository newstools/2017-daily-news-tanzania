EU-KUWAKI is the project of strengthening smallholder farmers abilities in the production and marketing of vegetables (EU KUWAKI).The project targets at training 2,500 small scale-scale farming households, mainly women, in 66 villages in 15 wards of Iramba, Singida rural and Mkalama districts in Singida Region.A Swiss NGO based in country has reached this decision after sensitization on horticulture in Singida where over 20 women groups have shown interest to engage in such activity during the implementation of EU-KUWAKI project.The EU-KUWAKI project officer, Mr Folo Ndokeji told the Daily News yesterday here that the regional authorities have to continue replicate the model that has been used by Helvetas after the project period comes to an end in December this year . I think it is too late for HEVETAS Swiss intercooperation to continuing giving such service because EU-KUWAKI project will soon close its businesses.So it is important for the regional authorities to continue spreading these activities to the other districts that have been in the project but were yet to be involved in the project, said Mr Ndokeji.He said that Singida regional authorities ought to replicate the model if wants to promote such horticulture in order to benefit many who have been sensitised with the implementation of the EU-KUWAKI project.Mr Ndokeji said that EU-KUWAKI project has been implementing these activities in Iramba, Mkalama and Singida Dc districts where the project has registered a lot of achievements.He said that this system will be helpful if financial institutions like CRDB,NMB,SIDO and Vision Fund just to mention will be ready to support vegetable producers with financial resources through provision of loans so as to sustain vegetable production and hence improve livelihoods to the community in Singida.
