He, however, noted that another comprehensive survey was needed to establish the actual deposits in order to decide if large scale commercial mining can be conducted or not.Dr Kalemani was answering a question by Mr Kasuku Bilago (Buyungu-Chadema) who wanted to know if there were any surveys conducted at Kakonko to find out if there were any mineral deposits.The legislator also wanted to know if there were (surveys) which minerals were found and where exactly (in the district). The deputy minister said the government, through Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST), started to conduct the surveys since 1970. He said some of the survey areas included Kakonko geological map (QDS 43), Kalenge (QDS 43) and Kibondo (QDS 58).According to him, between 1980 and 1985, the government in collaboration with UNDP conducted another survey on limestone at Bumuli, Kakonko District. These surveys established that there is presence of gold at Nyamwironge (Mwiruzi) and Nyakayenze areas, limestone at Bumuli, agate at Keza, Kibingo and Nkuba areas and diatomite at Kasanda area.In-depth surveys are needed in order to establish if available minerals discovered in previous surveys can be mined commercially explained Dr Kalemani.He therefore urged private companies to conduct in-depth surveys and develop mining activities at such areas. In his supplementary questions, Mr Bilago asked the government to issue guidelines on such deposits so that small scale miners can start mining limestone in the area which is believed to be Grade 2.The legislator also asked the government to subsidize small scale miners so that they can start mining gold in the surveyed areas. Dr Kalemani said that the mining law and conservation areas legislation had stipulated guidelines on how the miners can start mining in such areas. We have already issued 76 licenses to small scale miners at Nyakayenze and Nyamwironge, I appeal to the MP to sensitize more miners to follow suit he further said.Dr Kalemani also informed the august House that no licensed investor was allowed to start mining without first communicating with relevant council and local authorities in order to reduce unnecessary conflicts.He was responding to Mr Nape Nnauye (Mtama-CCM) who asked why the government was not involving local community authorities in such mining activities and therefore causing unnecessary conflicts.
