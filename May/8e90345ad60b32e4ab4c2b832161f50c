We had our expectations and it was disappointing for us to lose this last match when we needed a draw to go through; what we have to live with this unfortunate result despite coming close, said Serengeti Boys assistant coach, Milambo Oscar.

We have learned so much and I think this would put us in good position to compete well at home when we host the continent in 2019, he said.
