The funding will help support small scale farmers, livestock keepers and fishers obtain concessional loans, to buy farming tools and improve productivity.Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Mr William Ole Nasha, told the National Assembly that following the government s resolve to support the bank, it has released an additional 246bn/- for the financial year 2016/17. The money has already been banked with the TADB, the Deputy Minister said when reacting to a supplementary question from Tunduma MP, Frank Mwakajoka (Chadema).The lawmaker observed that, since the institution was established, the government promised to release 800bn/- to support the bank. Unfortunately only 60bn/- had been released, making the bank fail to perform its roles of supporting small scale farmers and fishers. The Deputy Minister said the government was committed to support the agriculture sector to advance development of the industrial economy in the country.Meanwhile, Mr Nasha said the government had intensified operations against illegal fishing gears, saying all those who will be found using them, especially nets, will face the music.He maintained that the fishing sector was facing serious crisis. The Fishing Act No 22 of 2009 criminalises use of prohibited fishing nets and explosive materials. We will confiscate all the illegal fishing nets found by authorities.This is not only for authorities, but it is the responsibility of every one of us, he said in response to Bukoba MP, Jasson Rweikiza.The MP was concerned as to why the government had not arrested businessmen behind importation and sell of prohibited fishing nets.Mr Nasha, however, said most fishermen were traditionally producing destructive fishing nets thus putting the fishing sector at greater risk.
