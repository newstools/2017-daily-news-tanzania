The 0.3m US dollars project is supported by TradeMark East Africa (TMEA). TMEA said in a statement that TBS had sought their assistance to upgrade and overhaul its entire network to address existing challenges including downtime and data surges."Components of the existing infrastructure were obsolete which meant support could not be provided by the vendors. The current infrastructure did not adequately address security concerns within the Local Area Network."More importantly, there was need to connect remote TBS and border offices to allow normal operations and business to be conducted.Border stations use to receive information such as results for tests or certifications through postal services which could at times almost a week to reach its destination and an extra 3-4 days to process." The project has also catered for the provision of a wide area network (WAN) to allow seamless communication between the HQ and border offices.Offices connected on the WAN include the TBS Lake Zone which covers the Mwanza, Mara and Kagera regions. Similarly the TBS Southern Highlands Zone which covers the Mbeya region will be covered. TBS zonal office at strategic locations including ports and border posts will be covered.With implementation of the connectivity project, TBS enforcement of Tanzania s trade facilitation standards will be improved with expected time and cost saving.TBS Zonal and border offices can access laboratory result reports through Quality Information Management System thus improving efficiency at the border and ensure that staff in remote offices have access to the TBS system.TMEA support to the connectivity project is part of a wider support to the TBS with the aim of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of TBS in the regulation and enforcement of standards in Tanzania which was signed in 2016.TMEA existing support to TBS constitutes procuring and delivering two categories of testing equipment which included minilaboratory equipment and glassware; and laboratory integrity fuel kit as well development of an Integrated Quality Management Information System and an eLearning platform. These interventions are expected to contribute to a reduction in time and cost.
