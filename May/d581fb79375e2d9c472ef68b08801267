The big news in Tanzania now is that some media houses are taking to blacklisting some government leaders from reaching their audiences.Accordingly, the Minister for Information, Sports, Arts and Culture Dr Harrison Mwakyembe has expressed concern over apparent attempts at blacklisting certain government authorities, and has cautioned that such tendency was not only unprofessional but also prevents such leaders from exercising his noble duties.Dr Mwakyembe expressed these grave reservations at a function where he graced World Freedom Day celebrations today, expressing government commitment in ensuring press freedom and free flow of information across the country." I think we need to revisit some of the reactions when we think we are offended. Actions like black out coverage of some leaders are not fair as they prevent them from delivering their messages to the public," the Minister stressed.Dr Mwakyembe responded to some of the issues as raised by media stakeholders, calling for media players to distinguish media business with other businesses due to its nature and importance.He said the government understand that media houses have an interest in operating profitably, but cautioned that the profit motive shouldn t override the need to run their media houses professionally and, in turn, managed by credible and ethical personnel.For all media to prosper, the minister pledged an enabling environment, but stressed there should be maximum observation of the national interests so as to avoid unnecessary confrontation with law enforcement authorities.He also insisted there should be continuous training among media personnel as a matter of paramount importance, saying today s media would require well trained staff to cope with the sweeping changes across the world.Even then, he was quick to commend jobs well done by some of the media houses in efforts to uncover the evils within society."We are grateful to (some) media houses out to assist the government in uncovering vices please maintain that and invest into the investigative reporting to facilitate that task," he noted.Earlier, representatives of different media houses and institutions delivered their messages in marking the day with Chairperson of the Media Institute for southern Africa, Tanzania Chapter (MISA-TAN), Ms Salome Kitomari, asking the government to ensure the security of pressmen which she said was at stake in recent days. Ms Kitomari said the government should also work with media stakeholders to ensure Parliamentary sessions were aired live like it was the case in the past even as media owners should also be tasked to strictly observe security of employment of their employees including paying them fairly.
