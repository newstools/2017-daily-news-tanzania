Paid once during issuance a title deed, and predicated on the country s 1999 land law, the reductions come as an olive branch to forestall spontaneous settlements the bane of almost all urban centres in Tanzania -- just as the nation gears up for massive investments in real estates at its new seat of governance in Dodoma.Currently pegged at 7.5 per cent of the total value of the land, the service charges now go down to a paltry 2.5 per cent from the next financial calendar, says Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr William Lukuvi.This is about 67 per cent reduction, which Mr Lukuvi, yesterday described as a significant move to enable many Tanzanians gain access to formal land ownership and plots for building decent houses and rid themselves of squalid living quarters .Mr Lukuvi pointed out that the move also aims at giving formal title deeds to majority of Tanzanians. The reduced fee will attract citizens owning pieces of land to turn out and seek the services of land surveyors, a critical step to getting formal title deeds, Mr Lukuvi said, expressing optimism that many would take advantage of this relief and have their lands surveyed. The minister made these landmark announcements when presenting his ministry s budget estimates, amounting to 70.7billion/-; some 45.3bn/- of this will go into recurrent expenditure and 25.4bn for development activities.The minister said his ministry targets to collect a total of 112bn/- from different taxes and levies from the lands sector during the year ahead, adding that his officials would also work with all councils as in the past -- in preparing plans for developing cities and villages, supervising surveying, land formalization and registration of title deeds.Mr Lukuvi appealed to the stakeholders to accord his ministry the cooperation it requires to ensure that the lands sector plays its role facilitat- ing other s e c - tors a t - tain their goals.To meet the government s resolve to achieve its industrialization agenda, for instance, a total of 83,080 acres in industrial strategic areas will have to be produced across 14 councils countrywide.This figure is on top of the 19,050 acres in industrial estates during FY 2015/16, noting that the ministry would continue pushing the councils to allocate more land for industrial purposes during FY 2017/18.In the meantime, the Parliamentary Committee on Lands, Natural Resources and Tourism has advised the government to move in -- timely and resolve land conflicts across the country by promoting community knowledge on land use and their limitations.Tabling its recommendations, committee member Ms Silafu Maufi (Special Seats- CCM) also suggested that the government should increase the budget for land tribunals so that they could settle more conflicts more efficiently. The government should increase its pace of nullifying ownership of underutilized chunks of land so they can be transferred to the people who can fully utilize them, said Ms Maufi.Shadow Minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr Wilfred Lwakatare asked the government to retain all underutilized chunks of land, most of it owned by politicians.Presenting his alternative budget speech yesterday, Mr Lwakatare (Bukoba Urban-Chadema) said in 2013 a parliamentary select committee was formed to probe land conflicts across the country, a report of which was subsequently tabled in 2015.Among other things, the report had recommended that the government should take back all the underutilized plots and reallocate them to the needy individuals. The opposition camp has time and again made public the names of the individuals including politicians possessing huge chunks of land which deprives the locals from accessing the resource, he said, adding: We want to hear the government tell us how they are going to execute this key parliamentary recommendation. On this one, party ideologies must be put aside or else the government will be upholding double standards in fixing land problems, Mr Lwakatare observed, accusing some regional and district authorities of a tendency to interfere with powers of village and ward land tribunals. The tribunals are legally established and they have full powers to settle land wrangles in their areas. However there is a growing tendency of RCs and DCs to interfere with the tribunals autonomy and even bully tribunal leaders, he said.
