Mr Mongela who is on a special working tour of the district said forming academic committees in schools was part of the strategies his region was working on a number of strategies revive the sector.He said Ukerewe has been lacking proper management in a number of sectors and insisted he was not ready to see anybody tampering with education which is key to any development arena. I have been furnished with complaints on the general status of education offered in many schools and would like to emphasize on the formation of academic committees as part of remedial measures, Mr Mongela said.While many of the schools had established school boards and committees, it has been noted that many of them were not effective, a situation that calls for a need to revisit them.Swindling of capitation grants remains rampant in the region, however, the authorities were working on it and the RC warned that will soon be booked.He said he had formed a probe committee on the matter and was set to come to Ukerewe for the verifying because available reports indicate massive swindling of the funds and urged the culprits to return the funds in two-week time before they face legal measures and punitive action.
