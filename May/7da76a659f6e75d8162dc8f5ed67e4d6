Since the government embarked on a countrywide crackdown on phantom workers and subsequently expulsion of civil servants implicated of allegedly using phony academic certificates, the fund acknowledge it was not seriously harmed. We re very safe, however we have requested the government to supply the actual names of all civil servants who were listed as phantom officials and those with fake certificates, LAPF Acting Operation Manager Mr Victor Kikoti told reporters.The social scheme registered in 1944 and later re-established under the Local Authority Pension Fund Act No.9 of 2006 provides among other benefits, maternity, funeral and education grant.Other benefits are retirement pension, survivorship benefits, invalidity pension, withdrawal in respect of; marriage, emigration or unemployment, and sickness benefits. Our policy is very clear and intact.We provide loans not exceeding 75 per cent of the contribution ... this means even if they will be forced out of their workstation there still alternative to settle the debt, he said.Adding: we cannot rush to conclude as the same government had allowed those who feel victimised with the nationwide exercise to appeal before May 15. As of April this year, the scheme had already spent over 2.4bn/- to fund some 1,438 members who wanted to further their academics at the higher learning institutions within and outside the country. In additional, the fund had released 9.54bn/- to 11,744 members who had applied for maternity benefit as of April this year.LAPF s Head of Sales and Communications, Mr James Mlowe told reporters that the scheme had lately been performing very well.He said after the fund was detached from local government authorities, now it had penetrated in other sectors that were formerly dominated with other social schemes. I can confirm we have penetrated very well in the private sector and now teachers. The public has built trust in our fund since we deliver. He cited the recently 3,084 teachers employments announced by the government detailing that out of 2,792 teachers who legitimately reported to their new workstations about 1,888 or 68 per cent become new members.Yet, we project to secure 12,000 out of 15,000 new employees that the government plans to employ before July this year, the senior official said at a press conference.LAPF had a total of 172,000 members, having registered at least 16,839 new members during the proceeding financial year even with the government openly suspending new jobs early last year.
