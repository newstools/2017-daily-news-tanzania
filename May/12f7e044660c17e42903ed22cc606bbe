 I have competed in three rallies and managed to finish two of them in Iringa and Bagamoyo.I am here to stay as a rally driver since there is a bright future in it, said Mosha whose daredevil driving in Bagamoyo won him a huge number of fans. He said rejoining motor rally after over a decade in politics-marred football, has given him a relief since he has found friendship and kind of sportsmanship rarely seen in football.Now driving Subaru Impreza N12, Davis Mosha was among the members of the famous Stado Rally team who has announced a come-back after almost a 10-year retirement.After the end of the third round, Mosha has accumulated 16 total seeding points that place him in the top 10 berth. He opened this season with 6 points after finishing seventh in Mkwawa Rally of Iringa before adding 10 points in Bagamoyo last weekend after carving a 5th position.Mosha and his Stado team mates, Ahmed Huwel from Iringa and the Morogoro- based Sameer Shanto, all contributed much to the success of the just ended rally as both participants and sponsors. Titled Stado Mzizima Rally, the third round was also sponsored by members of Stado Rally team.Other members besides, Mosha, Huwel and Shanto was Omar Bakhresa who backed under Azam TV. Back in 2005, Davis Mosha as a driver and sponsor, fought for the re-establishment Kilimanjaro Rally, which has remained very powerful today.Titled TIOT Rally, the inaugural Kilimanjaro rally won hearts of thousands. Mosha who spearheaded the comeback of motor rally in Kilimanjaro said it was then the second round of the National Rally Championship of 2005. Mosha claimed the fifth position in the Mobitel Millennium Rally of 2000 that started in Nairobi and ended at New Africa Hotel.
