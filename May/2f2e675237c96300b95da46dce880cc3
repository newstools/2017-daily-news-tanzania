Mara Region s Acting Medical Doctor, Dr Nila Jackson, said during a twoday stakeholders meeting held in Dar es Salaam at the weekend, that the success has been attributed to the regional authority s decision to give family planning top priority attention. Our regional commissioner has been instrumental in treating the issue as fundamental, he said. Tanzania has increased application of modern family planning methods, though the pace hasn t been very encouraging.Family planning methods increased from 27 per cent in 2010 to 32 per cent in 2015 and the country s goal is to reach to 45 per cent by 2020. Deaths associated with child birth decreased from 556 in every 100,000 mothers to 454/100,000 between 2010 and 2015.Dr Jackson further remarked: The success we have attained partly derives from the fact that we hold stakeholders meetings at monthly intervals, and based on statistics, we discuss challenges and chart strategies for enlightening the public on the advantages of using modern family planning methods. He explained that, in partnership with other stakeholders, the regional government launched a campaign for promoting modern family planning and the response was good. Mara Region has also been partnering with traditional elders in educating the public on the issue.Dr Jackson pointed out that, since the region was deeply steeped in customs and traditions, side-stepping traditional healers would have been counterproductive.The Technical Advocacy Manager of the Tanzania Communication and Development Centre (TCDC), Mr James Mlali, called on the government to invest considerably and consistently in family planning campaign.Mr cited premature pregnancies, which increased from 22 per cent in 2010 to 27 per cent in 2015, was one of the critical problems that called for concerted attention.
