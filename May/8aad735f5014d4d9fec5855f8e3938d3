The Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that in the past it was common to find a young man carrying a book on a Daladala, saying the culture of reading a book had since become a thing of the past. Previously, book reading was fashionable to every youth but If you find a young person in the library today, then the exams are around the corner, the minister quipped, at the launch of a book,The Color of Life by Ritha Tarimo. Dr Mwakyembe hailed the author for defying all the odds and writing a book at this juncture when you must read in order to write a book. This demonstrates that there are still young people who have the culture of books reading, said Dr Mwakyembe.Ms Ritha Tarimo, the book author, said that The Color of Life was a poetic, provoking, and life changing book, urging young people, largely secondary and university students, to read the inspirational book. It s through people s knowledge and understanding that we can achieve the most profound change, she said, further observing that the book urges each person to live life to the fullest. Publishing my own book has been a dream come true and The Colour of Life is my first published work, said she, an MBA holder from the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI) in Arusha Region.
