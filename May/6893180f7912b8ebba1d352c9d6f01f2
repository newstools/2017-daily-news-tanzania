The new partnership was announced here yesterday just a few months after the government enacted the Legal Aid Act, 2016 that gives full recognition of paralegals in the legal sector. There is no doubt that the provision of legal aid and related services has substantially improved in the country.It, hence, provides relief to poor men and women, whose rights have been violated for various reasons. At a meeting convened here under the umbrella of the TLS, that brought together advocates, paralegals, and legal organisations from across the Mainland, they resolved to working together to complement one another.TLS Executive Secretary Mr Kaleni Gamaya said there has been a number of challenges with regard to access of justice, with the judiciary taking the most stinging blame. We notice that we all complement each other and should be a proper mechanism that will help save justice, he said. We have prepared a proper mechanism which was approved by the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.This means from now on paralegals will be trained and in case the matter is beyond their capacity they will engage the legal organisation. If it is proved that the matter is more complex, the organisation will inform TLS who would later take the matter to the next level. The formal procedures are due for application this July.This will allow legal experts move across 158 districts on the Mainland to offer legal services. The secretary announced that the programme will be a fouryear initiative currently funded by the Legal Service Facility.
