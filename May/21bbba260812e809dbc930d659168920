Dar es Salaam Special Zone Commissioner of Police, Mr Simon Sirro told journalists yesterday that the suspects were arrested for stealing the drugs from the body of a Ghanaian national. The Ghanaian national was reported dead on March 14, 2017 at the Red Carpet Guest House in Sinza after swallowing the drugs, and the body was taken to Mwananyamala Hospital Mortuary, said Commissioner Sirro.He pointed out that the mortuary attendant, Athumani Amiry Mgonja (48), admitted to operating on the deceased body and taking the 32 pellets of drugs which he handed to a businessman by the name of Omary Wagile (47).Commissioner Sirro said that during interrogation the mortuary attendant went on to reveal that after handing the drugs to Wagile, the drugs were sold to Ally Mahamud Nyundo (41), a businessman from Tabata, Segerea. It seems the hospital attendants were tipped off on the fact that the body had the narcotic drugs in it, he said. He named the other mortuary attendant who was arrested as Omar Abdallah Rukola (47), a resident of Pugu Kigogo Fresh. The Nyundo who is referred to in this matter is the same person who was in the list of the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner (RC), Paul Makonda for dealing in drugs .. after being tested, it was confirmed that the suspect was using narcotic drugs, he noted.
