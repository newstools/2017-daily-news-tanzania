School Headmaster Mwalimu Faith Moshiro said the rainwater flows from nearby hills because all the classrooms are located downstream, and that the current downpours had set in motion currents that sweep debris and mud into the institution. Sometimes the water levels in class rise kneedeep so we get compelled to send the pupils back home or at lesser scale, make them spend several hours draining the murky liquids from the rooms before resuming lessons, she said.Sing isi now in operation for 62 years, is now partial home to 824 pupils from class one to seven in dual streams --Technical and Education and the rains seem to affect mostly four classrooms hosting 231 pupils in classes Five and Six as well as teachers offices.The Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA), upon hearing of the predicament, sent a delegation to the school, located in Arumeru District of Arusha Region and donated four million shillings (4m/-) to help the management construct permanent drainage systems, a school wall and repair some leaking roofs.The CBA Company Executive Officer, Mr Gift Shoko who presented the cheque to the school management, said primary education formed the basis for formal education and produces 80 percent of the country s workforce. Which means, all our future clients are being hatched from primary school pupils and it is our corporate social responsibility to ensure that all of these get their education properly in order to become responsible adults and national manpower, said Mr Shoko.The CBA official said it wasn t the first time that his bank was extending a helping hand to the Sing isi school. We once brought here electrical equipment and tools to furnish the technical education branch here, said the CEO, whose sentiments were echoed by the school s managers who revealed that the Bank s assistance had since helped more than 150 students.The Sing isi school was founded in 1953, then labelled bush satellite school before becoming full-fledged primary education entity in 1955. The Technical Education stream was added 20 years later in 1975.
