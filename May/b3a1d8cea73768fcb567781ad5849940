In a State House statement issued in Dar es Salaam yesterday, President John Magufuli consented to the requests from the trio for their early retirement, with Mr Sadiki confirming that among reasons behind his request for early retirement is attributed to health issues and need to pave way for the youth to lead.On part of the two judges, the Registrar of the High Court, Mr Ilvin Mgeta, could not confirm when reached for comment on whether health issues were the reasons indicated in the retirement letters to the Head of State.However, the registrar was quick to point out that indeed Judge Msuya was sick and has not been seen in court corridors for quite some time now. It is true Judge Msuya is sick and it is for this reason that has affected her judicial performance, he said.Mr Mgeta could not go into details on the matter, including the circumstances that forced Judge Mujulizi, who also served as Chairman of the Judicial Service Commission of Tanzania, to opt for early retirement.He said that there could be other confidential reasons best known to the two judges and the appointing authority that have led them to write such letters.Efforts to reach the two judges for their comments proved futile. Judge Mujulizi, the former principal of the Lushoto Institute of Judicial Administration is one of the judges who were implicated in the Tegeta Escrow scandal, a scam which rocked the nation in 2014.His name appeared in the list of people who received money from James Rugemalira, the owner of VIP Engineering.The parliament, after a probe team which was formed to examine the matter tabled their resolution, after which the House asked the president to form an inquiry team to investigate him.However, the fourth phase President Jakaya Kikwete is on record as saying that due to the judicial procedure the matter was left on the hands of the Chief Justice.At the time, the Chief Justice was Mohamed Chande Othman who left the office early this year. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday in Moshi town, Mr Sadiki thanked President John Magufuli and his predecessors for the trust they have had in him, but said it was time to say goodbye to the civil service for good.Mr Sadiki, who was speaking after the State House statement on President Magufuli s consent to his retirement request went viral on social media, said the youth are more effective in leadership roles, hence he finds it fit to leave the office at this juncture to pave ways for them, if it would please the president. We have to give way for the youth, that is open and I am doing just that in this as they can do better than people of our age.I really thank President Magufuli and his predecessors for trust they put in me.I have all along worked hard and with professionalism and now I say goodbye, said Mr Sadiki.The former RC was posted to Kilimanjaro from Dar es Salaam in March last year and took over from Mr Amos Makala who had a short stint from September 2015.
