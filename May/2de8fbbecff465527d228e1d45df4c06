Taking the floor to clear the air over the matter, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told the august House that the government has formed a task force to review the law that formed the CDA, an agency in charge of overseeing the development of Dodoma region and facilitating land ownership by locals and investors.The PM was responding to a question by Special Seats Member of Parliament, Kunti Majala (Chadema), who wanted the Premier to issue a statement on when the government would act on complaints by Dodoma residents which they raised to President John Magufuli during the 2015 presidential campaigns.Majala was concerned that President Magufuli promised to repeal the law that formed CDA as soon as he assumed office, and claimed that nothing had since been done to implement his pledge. This agency was legally established by the government, but we now want to review its law to allow vast land ownership by citizens and investors. Let us give time to the taskforce to complete its job and advise the government on how best we can suspend CDA, the premier said.The PM insisted that it was important to review the law to attract investors, and that such changes would also facilitate smooth relocation of the government to Dodoma and foster development.The premier noted that all the promises that were made by President John Magufuli during his 2015 presidential campaigns will be implemented in a period of five years, until 2020. In another development, Mr Majaliwa underscored the need for Tanzanians to protect the environment, especially water sources to save the government from spending money in search of reliable sources of water supply.He said that legislators should take part in conserving the environment, saying that most of the challenges the country was facing in implementing water projects were caused by environmental degradation.But he added that efforts were already underway to ensure that Tanzanians get water at least 400 metres from their homes.He was responding to a question by Liwale MP Zuberi Kuchauka (CUF) who wanted to know if the government was ready to implement its water policy, which states that villagers should source water at least 400 metres from their homes.
