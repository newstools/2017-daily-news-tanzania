He noted that they always produce and sell at wholesale price and as of now, the factory was on its normal annual closing schedule, but also to pave the way for maintenance of machines. Mr Ally said they closed production on normal routine in March and will resume production by June, this year.He said that they don t have sugar in their warehouses as the entire product had been sold. He revealed that this season, they had produced above their set target (110,000 tonnes) as they reached a record 111,800 tonnes, while last season they produced 95,000 tonnes of the sweetener and would always like to produce more to meet market demand.The Kilombero Sugar Company Public Relations Manager, Mr Henry Muchunguzi, told the Daily News over the phone yesterday that he was not aware of price increases in the market, saying the issue was crosscutting. So far, the wholesale price at the sugar factory has remained the same.But, the issue of pricing also involves regulatory authorities and marketing, said the Kilombero Sugar Public Relations Manager.
