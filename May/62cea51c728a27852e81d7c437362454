Addressing the just-ended 10th Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC) meeting at the State House in Dar es Salaam, Dr Tizeba -- the Minister for Agriculture, Food, Livestock and Fisheries -- said that, given the country s eagerness to become a middle-income economy, serious promotion of the agricultural sector was inescapable. (Promotion of) agriculture is unavoidable when it comes to the government s determination to make Tanzania an industrial country because raw materials for those industries will be derived from crops, Mr Tizeba told the meeting chaired by President John Magufuli.The minister told the meeting, which brings together varied and strategic representatives of the business community, that he firmly believed that, a middle- income Tanzania was feasible, but towards attainment of that goal, massive investments must be channelled into the sector.He noted that the prices of fertilizers were very high, adding that several researches had shown that the best way out was to secure fertilizers through bulk procurement tendering. Reduced prices, he pointed out, would give farmers relief and encourage growth. Dr Tizeba said local improved seeds were more expensive than imported ones. It is strange to learn, for example, that one kilogramme of imported seeds costs 1,500/- while a kilo of locally grown seeds costs 7,000/-, he told the audience, adding, moreover, that, the seeds were in short supply and did not reach all farmers.He reported that the post-harvest losses rate of all crops currently stood at 48 per cent, adding that the ministry was exploring various options of reversing the trend. President Magufuli said the outcome of the meeting delighted him, and called for a similar one to be organized in the near future.
