The 3.55bn US dollar Intergovernmental agreement (IGA) was signed in Kampala Uganda by the Minister for Constitution and Legal Affairs, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi and Ugandan Minister for Energy, Eng Irene Muloni.The two ministers put pen to paper hardly five days after President John Magufuli and his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni signed a communiqu upon completion of discussions on sections of the contract. The signing of the contract sets the pipeline construction project in motion.According to a statement released by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the agreement signing ceremony which took place at Serena Hotel in Kampala was attended by various leaders from the two countries.The leaders include Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, State Attorneys, Directors and leaders from government institutions. Last Sunday, President Magufuli and his Ugandan counterpart signed a communique agreeing to start construction of the East African Crude Oil pipeline (EACOP) project from Hoima in Uganda to Tanga Port in Tanzania.The signing was witnessed by ministers, senior government officials from different institutions which are involved in the project.The two countries have been negotiating how to proceed with the EACOP project after the East African countries agreed in April last year to the pipeline going through Tanzania. The communiqu signed in Dar es Salaam adds that a date for the two presidents to lay a foundation stone at either Hoima or Tanga will be arranged as soon as possible.The 1,443-kilometre crude oil pipeline will be able to transport 200,000 litres of oil per day once the project starts its operation.The project will be able to generate employment between 6,000 and 10,000 people. President Magufuli described it as important for the development of the two countries and East African region in general.The Head of State expressed appreciation to President Museveni for being instrumental in propelling the project, which signified the solid friendship between the two countries. He commended experts and government officials from both countries, including ministers and legal experts, who worked tirelessly to iron out bottlenecks that included differences in tax regimes.On the other hand, President Museveni described Tanga Port as key because of its geographical location and security. He said that the project will also make fuel cheaper hence foster aviation industry, whereby regional airlines will get cheaper jet fuel.He added that one of the major reasons that influenced his decision to choose Tanzania as co-host of the pipeline was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere s staunch pan-African patriotism, the push for East African political Federation and fighting tribalism.
