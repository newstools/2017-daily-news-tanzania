Regional Commissioner (RC) Saidi Meck Sadiki said here that following the presidential directive on all children to have the desks in classes, stakeholders were highly moved to complete the task.He said that as students take their seats, at primary schools there are 11,978 extra desks while at secondary schools level there are 4,710 desks. He said if there are some other regions in need of the desks, Kilimanjaro could offer them after negotiating terms.He said the region is well on track in offering free education from Standard one in primary education to Form IV in secondary education. In implementing free education the region has received over 18bn/-, out of which 13bn/-is for secondary education and 5.147bn/- for primary education. This has highly been helpful to bring up the number of enrollment, both at Standard I and Form I in the region, said the RC.In the same line of improving education, some 71,161,200/- have been set aside for construction of a dormitory for girls at Oshara Secondary School. Constructions have already started.This will help in the war against school pregnancies in a way, as some of the reasons cited often for the pregnancies is long distance that students cover when are travelling to and from school.Mr Sadiki said that Moshi Technical Secondary School that was on pathetic situation has received a major boost, as now its infrastructure would be repaired.He unveiled that the Central Government has issued over 2bn/- to renovate one of the oldest schools that includes students with disabilities.Also, science subjects have been top on the agenda, with 259m/- set aside for construction of the science laboratory at Kamwala Secondary School in Mwanga District.
