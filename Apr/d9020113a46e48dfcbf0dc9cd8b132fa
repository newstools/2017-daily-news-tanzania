We have already completed all preparations of 2017 elections expected to be held on 1 April, this year, including distribution of all equipment in all regions and districts in the country to accomplish the election, he said. We continue to motivate the right candidates to come up in big numbers in order to contest in various positions within the party starting from branch, ward, district, region and at national level, among others.
