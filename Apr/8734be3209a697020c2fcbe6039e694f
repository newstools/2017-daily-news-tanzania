The Acting Chairman of Karagwe Municipal council, Mr Dauson Byamanyirwoi said although people continue down playing agricultural activities, the fact is that it remains to be the backbone of the country s economy not only in the country, but also in most nations worldwide.Mr Byamanyirwoi speaking during a seminar held here directed agricultural officers in the district to ensure farmers are assisted and advised to cultivate various crops that can resist drought and harvest adequate food crops. It is indisputable that in the past six months, all of us experienced food shortages in our households in this district. Due to the hard time experience, we are now supposed to make concerted efforts to cultivate enough food crops for our stocks, he advised.However, Mr Byamanyirwoi said that in order to avoid poverty, farmers should now use their time and the current rains judiciously in cultivating alternative crops that can be ready in a short period.The acting chairman also appealed to extension officers to educate farmers in villages about modern farming to enable them improve their harvests and household food security.A similar appeal was echoed by the Karagwe Municipal Council Assistant Director, Eng. Wolta Kirita, that farmers deserve to get every possible support for improving agricultural production if we really need to promote food and cash crops output. We thank Open Forum for Agriculture Biotechnology seminar organised by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) for their commitment to educate agro extension officers on good methods of farming, a move that would help to control diseases in crops and introduction of drought tolerant varieties, he noted.Adding, This is the right time that our farmers engage in modern agriculcuture by using various technologies. For her part, acting Karagwe District Administrative Secretary, Ms Nyangele Makunenge, said that efforts has been done in encouraging farmers in Karagwe District to focus on modern agricultural activities. We thank COSTECH for this special training to agro extension officers in the district. We promise to collaborate with OFAB in ensuring our farmers benefit from the agriculture sector, she said.The OFAB country coordinator, Philbert Nyinondi said the main aim of the project is to support government s efforts of making Tanzania become an industrialised nation.
