As we are looking forward to carry out major transformation changes in the institute, availability of teaching equipment and instruments are very important, he noted.TaSUBa top boss, however, urged other stakeholders, culture and art-lovers to support the institute with number of equipment and instruments as they still have the shortage.Dr Makoye said the support will also help to shape well Tanzanian musicians to have the ability to play music instruments, saying there are number of claims pointed to local musicians that they cannot use music instruments.Danish ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Jensen said music and art in general are essential in preserving cultures and norms of a certain society. Music is the way we can express our feelings and preserve our cultures, but you cannot do it without instruments, thus is why we were pushed to support TaSUBa.You will have an opportunity to teach the young generation, said the Ambassador.
