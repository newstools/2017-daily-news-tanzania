A family spokesperson, Mr Joseph Mapunda, said the funeral will be preceded by last respects to be paid at 8.30 am at his residence, Msasani Road plot number 366A.Born on May 7, 1928 in Mombasa, Kenya, J. K. Chande was a man of rare integrity and intellect who literally spent his entire adult life rendering selfless service to the government and the people of Tanzania and elsewhere in the world.Commonly known by his friends as Andy, he was a gentle, modest and resourceful man who passionately believed in the service and development of his fellow human beings in Tanzania and beyond.This was demonstrated through his dedicated and tireless involvement in many activities of social, economic and humanitarian interest. In recognition of this, in August 2003, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II made him an Honorary Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE).Commenting on the award, the then Tanzania s President Benjamin William Mkapa said he rejoiced to witness the conferment upon a distinguished Tanzanian of a most deserved Order of Knighthood in the British Empire. It was deserved because it marked a recognition of a long life of service to the people of Tanzania by a Tanzanian patriot; a recognition testified by an important and powerful external polity .Sir Chande was also honoured in 2005 by the President of India with the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award, which is the highest recognition India gives to a member of its diaspora. In 2005, he published his autobiography titled A Knight in Africa: Journey from Bukene which contains a foreword by Tanzania s third phase President Benjamin William Mkapa. The book was launched by Tanzania s former Prime Minister Frederick T.Sumaye and the Speaker of Canada s Senate, Senator Dan Hayes. The launch in Kenya was attended by the then Kenyan Vice-President Moody Awori. The proceeds of the sale of the book were directed at augmenting efforts to eradicate malaria in Tanzania. While launching the Kiswahili version of the book in Kampala on 16th February, 2007, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda praised Sir Chande and said: You have made significant contribution for our brothers in Tanzania, for which I commend you .Officiating at the launch of the Kiswahili version of the book on 10th August, 2007 Tanzania s former President Jakaya Kikwete described Sir Chande as an exceptional nationalist. You have, for many years, served our country diligently and with extreme honesty; and you have done so without complaining or even getting tired. You are, even now, continuing to serve our nation in several positions, despite your advanced age.We are greatly thankful to you for your exemplary service to our country and our people, he said. In 2004, Sir Chande also published many of his speeches, lectures and articles on Freemasonry in a book titled Whither Directing Your Course and in 2011 he also published under the title Transitions of a Life .The topics covered focussed on history, politics, business, environment, education as well as social spheres. A man of persuasive charm and intellect, Sir Chande was ever involved in practically every activity of national and community interest, underscoring his principle of hard work is good for life .Sir Chande s patriotism and commitment to Tanzania was for the first time clearly and firmly manifested in 1967 in the wake of the Arusha Declaration---a blueprint for socialist construction---- when his family business, Chande Industries Limited (a grain milling company) was nationalised by the government on 7th February, 1967.President Nyerere invited Sir Chande to help establish a homogenous milling corporation out of nine nationalised milling companies. He accepted the appointment and faithfully served as Chief Executive Officer of the newly created National Milling Corporation for five years.After retirement, he also spent another five years as its advisor and as a member of the Board of Directors. In the years leading to full independence of Tanganyika (now Mainland Tanzania), Sir Chande served from 1958 to 1961 as a member of the Governor s Executive Council (Cabinet) and of the Legislative Council (LEGICO). In 1959, he had the privilege of having a one-to-one discussion with the British Secretary of State, Ian McLeod, in connection with Her Majesty s Government s proposal to grant self-government to Tanganyika.After independence, Sir Chande keenly and resourcefully participated in the country s many social and economic activities.At various times he ably served either as chairman or as a member of the Boards of Directors of several public and private companies, including Barclays Bank in Tanzania and Uganda as well as of the government and multi-government corporations, including the defunct East African Railways Corporation and East African Harbours Corporation.Following the break-up of the East African Community in 1977, Sir Chande was appointed the founder Chairman of Air Tanzania Corporation and later Chairman of the Tanzania Harbours Authority and of Tanzania Railways Corporation.Sir Chande was also involved in the mass media field in Tanzania, where among other engagements; he served for over 25 years as Chairman of Tanganyika Standard Newspapers Limited, publishers of the Daily News and Sunday News.He also served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of King George V Memorial Museum and of the National Museum of Tanzania for 28 years.
