It had contracted the state-owned Suma JKT to undertake renovation of the hospital s pharmacy, fix wiring and roofing.Mirembe Hospital Director, Dr Erasmus Mndeme, had said earlier that the hospital was facing critical challenges of a place to store medicines as the available one was too dilapidated.

With this renovation, we will fix the required shelves and procure all the required medicines for the facility. The Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Dr Mpoki Ulisubisya, who handed over the keys to the hospital director, urged MSD to consider building a community outlet to help people access medicines near their surroundings.He said MSD had been setting up pharmacies across the country, It is imperative if such efforts are also considered for Mirembe.
