The miners died after being trapped in the mine following the landslide. Such incidents have also been claiming lives in other mineral-rich regions.In averting further catastrophe at the mine, Tabora Regional Commissioner (RC) Aggrey Mwanri issued the ban on the gold mining site during his visit, accompanied by the regional security and safety committee.The aim of the tour was to personally see the scene of the accident and send his condolences to the relatives of the deceased.He said it had been deemed fit to temporally stop the mining activities to pave way for thorough verification of the safety of the mine and assess whether the regulations by the National Environmental Management Council and environmental protection plan were properly observed. The suspension (of mining activities) aims at enabling miners to continue with their activities under safe environment to avoid further loss of the nation manpower in similar accidents, he said.Mr Mwanri directed the Central and West Zone Assistant Minerals Commissioner Salim Salim and Regional Resident Minerals Officer Laurent Mayala to ensure that the interval from one pitch to another adheres to the requirements as stipulated in the law and regulations.He faulted the crowded mining pitches, saying they endangers the lives of people.
