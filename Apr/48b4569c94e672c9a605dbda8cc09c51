The Legislator made the statement yesterday when he was addressing small miners following a decision made by Shinyanga Region Commissioner Zainab Telack who gave them a week s ultimatum to vacate the site for an investor.MP said the area was given to small miners by President John Magufuli, whose orders had since revoked the licence belonging Messrs Pangea Minerals so that small miners could benefit from artisanal digging of the minerals in their place and now find themselves shocked by RC s orders giving them just a week to move from the area. When I heard this contradictory statement against the president I asked minister, chairman of the Council and finally RC to know if the president has changed his mind but she said no so I wonder where else this decision arises, Mr Salum said.
