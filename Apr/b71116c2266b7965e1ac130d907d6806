The frustrated and angry villagers have also proposed to the district council to set up a new board that can supervise the water projects as planned. The villagers claimed that due to the situation on the ground, the current board is divided.Speaking on behalf of other villagers, Mbokomu Councillor, Mr Joseph Kimambo, said the project has been completed and has been of a great help to residents of three villages, Korini North, Korini Central and Korini South, especially during dry seasons, when villagers walk long distances in search of water.He asserted that the board that was chosen by villagers has become a barrier in developing the project and village chairmen have been giving conflicting statements to the citizens. This project was initiated in 2014 after the government saw the water problems among its citizens; villagers contributed to dig trenches and offered their lands for the project without demanding for any compensations, Mr Kimambo said.While some officials from the board have been issuing directives to the public to contribute money when fetching water, money that would have helped in servicing the project, such as water treatment and repairs of infrastructure, others have been telling them not to pay a single cent, saying water comes from God.Mr Kimambo explained that every planned board meetings fails, as many members do not attend, which is why he said it would be wise to do away with the board. Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Saidi Meki Sadiki, said politics should not be involved in development matters and political parties should not prevent development. He said the parties should, instead, back up the government in development and that there is no free water projects in any country in the world. I give the board two weeks to meet and plan for reasonable charges in getting water so that citizens contribute to this project; failure of which we will disband the board and set up another one, he said. Water engineer from Moshi District Council, Mr Fadhili Mrutu, said the project has cost more than 1.3bn/- and would serve 10,371 people by the year 2022.It was launched on 2nd August 2014. He said a political challenge lies mainly in Korini South village which is under Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), while the other two are under Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA), hence political tensions at Korini South are high. The project so far remains under the district council authority.
