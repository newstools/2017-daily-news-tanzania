Pastor Kabwebwe, 37, operating from Sakina area, and a lady, Anna Kambey, also identified as Anna Mollel, are accused of attempting to secure Tanzanian Passports for the three aliens from Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) whom they had illegally harboured for three years.The duo and the third suspect, Harrison Laizer, were also found to have produced piles of forged birth certificates, counterfeit baptism documents and letters from local Ward Executive Officers.The Congolese, Glory Mwanza Lubingo, his wife Linda Mbaki Diangwe and daughter Berenice Glory had been living in Tanzania since 2015 and the local pastor was working to transform them into citizens through some forged documents, including birth and baptism certificates. We arrested the suspected aliens just as they were trying to apply and acquire Tanzanian Passports with assistance from the Ukombozi Church Management, explained the Arusha Regional Immigration Officer (RIO), Mr Ally Mohammed Dadi.The RIO expressed concern over religious leaders whom people trust yet turn into racketeers involving themselves in criminal matters that can easily jeopardize national security. The suspects, the foreigners and their church-based conduits, will be arraigned to answer various charges.Mwanza Lubingo, according to the RIO, was in the process of being renamed Glory Harrison Kimaro while the wife had to assume the new name, Linda John Khuley as their daughter would be renamed Berenice Glory Kimaro.The three entered the country from Congo on November 8, 2015. When immigration officers ransacked the Ukombozi Church at Sakina, they discovered piles of official letters from local Ward Executives, blank birth certificates, counterfeit church documents and baptism certificates from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Moshi.With the Moshi certificates, it is possible that the culprits had planned to claim that the three Congolese were born in Kilimanjaro Region.
