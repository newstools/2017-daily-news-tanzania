Mwenge Catholic University (MWECAU) Deputy Vice Chancellor, (Administration and Finance), Rev Dr Eugene Lyamtane said here that the country needs revision of the curriculum as there are concerns that graduates do not meet labour market requirements.He said while in 1974 graduates from primary and secondary school could earn a living, the situation now is quite different, as some from colleges and universities fail in life.Dr Lyamtane said there is a need to ensure 100 percent completion rate, pointing out to a research finding in 2014 which states that transition rate from Ordinary Level Secondary Education to Advanced Level Secondary Education was only 27.5 percent.Presenting his paper-- Quality of Education in Relation to Tanzania Union-- Prospects and Challenges at a public lecture here, Dr Lyamtane said new and good policies should be crafted to ensure quality education, with enough and qualified teachers and teaching materials.He mentioned the major stumbling blocks in education as infrastructure at learning institutions.Rev Lyamtane pointed out that in many learning institutions; there are shortages or absence of tutors houses, administration blocks, classrooms, latrines and electricity which is pertinent in the modern world where information and communication technology is highly valued.
