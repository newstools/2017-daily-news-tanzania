Delivering budget estimates for the 2017/18 financial year, the Prime Minister, Mr Kassim Majaliwa, ostensibly reminded politicians that true democracy embodies rights and responsibilities. The Premier was making an assessment of the country s political situation since the 2015 general election, which he described as calm and satisfactory .Aware of unrelenting tug-of-war between members of opposition parties versus ruling party, CCM and its government, Mr Majaliwa counselled political actors to refrain from divisive and confrontational politics and embrace politics that unifies people. We must build a society that respects and adheres to laws, the country s regulations and procedures and has political tolerance, the PM told the House. I urge all political stakeholders in the country to develop compromising culture, pursue developmental politics instead of confrontational politics, politics that unite our people rather than dividing them and responsible politics rather cheap politics, he urged.Mr Majaliwa said the country s prosperity and achievement of development plans was highly dependent on the prevailing peace and tranquility; hence, appealed to country s men and women to protect and honour the two pillars. We all have the responsibility to insist on peace so that we can execute our duties in a peaceful and tranquil environment, he told the lawmakers. He reminded that it was every citizen s task to build the economy of the country s and urged Tanzanians to work hard, pay tax voluntarily and disclose tax evaders.Although Tanzania has enjoyed national unity, peace and stability since independence, a political tug-of-war involving members of the opposition against the government has often characterised the political landscape of the country.Presenting Opposition Parties views on Prime Minister s budget proposal, Chadema Chairperson, Freeman Mbowe hit out at government, claiming it was bullying democracy by restricting politicians from participating in free and fair politics.Mbowe, who presides as leader of Opposition Camp in the Parliament, argued that the government should observe the rule of law and consider the opposition as key organs for free consultancy. The government should weigh up its success by critically analysing opinions from the opposition and make amends whenever necessary, claimed Mbowe.Mbowe s 48-page speech failed to recognise any achievement by the fifth-phase government under President John Magufuli, who has drawn widespread praise for his aggressive anti-graft and economic growth drive in a country where corruption is sighted as a major setback to socio-economic prosperity.In another development, the Prime Minister said the nation s security was in strong state thanks to a commendable job by defence and security organs in protecting its borders. The government continues to invest in the army by providing it with modern military equipment and by completing a grand project of constructing 6,064 residential houses, which was initiated in the year 2013/2014, he said.The Premier said the government through Prisons Force, was finalising a 10bn/- housing scheme for prison officers at Ukonga area in Dar es Salaam. The 12 storeys, once completed, will accommodate 320 families.On Thursday, the Prime Minister requested the Parliament to approve a 171,664,055,000/- for his office, of which, 74,643,339,000/- is recurrent expenses and 97,020,716,000/- is meant for development expenditure.Mr Majaliwa also requested the lawmakers to endorse a 121,652,262,000/- budget for Parliament Fund, whereas 114,452, 262,000/- is recurrent expenditure and 7,200,000,000/- is development expenditure.
