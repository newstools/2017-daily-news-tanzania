The health centre is Mamire Village in Babati District. Under the programme, PharmAccess has supported the centre by improving and constructing a laboratory at a cost of six million shillings and furnishing the facility with medical devices worth two million shillings.Mamire residents now won t have to travel the 14 kilometre-distance any more to a referral hospital in Mrara, Babati Town Centre as services will be offered at Mamire. Manyara Regional iCHF Manager, Hance Mwankenja said the devices delivered at the centre included blood sugar test kit, Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), testing kit for mixture of chemicals as well as a container that would be used to carry samples to be tested.Mwankenja noted that people could not get or feel like getting good service if there were no laboratory at the health facility, that was why efforts were taken to ensure the centre got one.He urged all people with no health insurance to enroll with iCHF because it had proved to be beneficial in different aspects. He told residents of the ward that the token 30,000/- per year for six people was reasonable and affordable, saying some families could sell chicken, get money and enroll with iCHF.He said it was not correct to say that people could not afford the cost. You should enroll with the iCHF so that you benefit from quality medical services enjoyed by people who have already registered. The situation has changed and we should change with it too.Medical costs are on the rise and the only way to mitigate it is to have medical insurance, said Mr Mwankenja. Babati District Commissioner (DC), Mr Raymond Mushi told Babati residents that they should enroll with the fund as they were already late. He said he did not see reason they were not in the roster.Some of Mamire residents said previously they failed to enroll with Community Health Fund (CHF) because the dispensary used to have no drugs.Mr Revocati Gaseri noted that since iCHF was introduced in the district the situation had changed for the better. Mr Gaseri noted that many people in the area raised cattle and the laboratory would help them detecting livestock illnesses.
