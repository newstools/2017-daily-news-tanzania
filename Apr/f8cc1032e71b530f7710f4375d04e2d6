The farmers made the decision here on Friday during a stakeholders meeting which was attended by vanilla farmers from Bukoba, Muleba and Misenyi districts and held in Bukoba municipality.They noted that vanilla was an alternative cash crop that will pull the farmers out of poverty, adding that joint efforts are needed to fight middle-men who eventually smuggle the crop to a neighbouring country.The General Manager of the farmers association, Maendeleo ya Wakulima Kagera (MAYAWA), Charles Kamando, informed the meeting that vanilla produced in Kagera region was the best in the world.However, he raised concern that due to increased smuggling, vanillin content had dropped from 3.3 percent in 2010 to 2.5 per cent in 2015, warning that if urgent action is not taken now the crop will drop further.
