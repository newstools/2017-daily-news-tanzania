The councils are required to allocate 10 per cent of their revenues from their own sources to economically empower the youth and women in their jurisdictions.But in Mtwara, the share seems to attract few youth groups, with an officer in charge for youth development in the council. Mr Mwakijala Adamson, noted yesterday that the major factor hindering them from accessing such loans was failure to form groups and apply for the loans. Even those in groups lack cooperation among themselves.They prefer to get loans individually, which is not applicable, Mr Adamson said in an interview with the Daily News in Mtwara. He cited, as an example, the vulnerable youth who benefited from the free-of-charge vocational training under the Youth Economic Empowerment (YEE).The youth get opportunity to join 6-month training on different courses depending on one s interest. Funded by the European Union (EU), the threeyear project which started in 2015 intends to enable the youth acquire ability to generate income through vocational skills they acquired.It is implemented by the Plan International Tanzania in collaboration with Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA) and other Non-Governmental Organsations.So far, at least 1,360 vulnerable youths have benefited from the programme, but Mr Adamson expressed his disappointment that those youths do not apply for the loans from the district councils to get capital for income generating activities.
