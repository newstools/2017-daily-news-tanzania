That comes after three illegal aliens were deported back to Mogadishu as five other suspects are to be arraigned next Monday.The Manyara Regional Immigration Office has listed the suspect s name as Ms Halima S. Bachu who has been working in the country, especially Arusha and Manyara regions, but as of late, she disappeared without trace, possibly after learning that security organs in the region were conducting special exercise to smoke out illegal immigrants and the people behind the racket.Speaking at his office in Babati, the Regional Immigration Officer for Manyara, RIO Peter Kundy, revealed that the suspect holds three passports, including a Kenyan travelling document, a Somalia and South African passports.Apparently, she uses all methods in her book to smuggle Somali, Ethiopians and Eritreans from their respective countries to South-Africa. Ms Bachu is reported to use the Kenyan and Tanzanian routes in transporting the immigrants under very dangerous and unhygienic conditions, including packing them tightly in shipping containers, under truck chasses or squeezed together in small vehicles, with or without provisions. We have the suspect s photographs, fingerprints and copies of passports that she usually travel with, therefore it is just a matter of time before we arrest her; Halima is currently out of the country but through security networks she won t reach very far, said Mr Kundy.In connection to that, the Manyara Immigration officers also arrested eight suspected illegal immigrants from Somalia who were hiding in Babati, Mbulu and Kiteto districts, after a thorough exercise to smoke out aliens in the precincts.Out of the eight suspects, three will be deported back to where they came from while five stand to be arraigned before courts of law to answer charges of illegal stay here.Those to be deported to Mogadishu include Mr Abdishakur Adam, Mr Mohamad Hardi and Mr Amiiri Hassan. Those that will be appearing in court early next week are Mr Adeno Sadaro, Mr Samwel Shugute, Mr Yoseph Domam and Mama Xumisido as well as one Lefmo Abo.
