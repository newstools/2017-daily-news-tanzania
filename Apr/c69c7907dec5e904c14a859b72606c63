I have returned to Dodoma and of course I have received the summons to appear before the Ethics committee, I m ready to face the charges, confirmed Ms Mdee, who is one of the most loquacious MPs in the House. She refused to comment on the allegations until she attends the hearing, which was initially scheduled for yesterday, only to be pushed to today.The Head of Information, Education and Communication Office of the National Assembly, Mr Owen Mwandumbya, said the Parliamentary Privileges, Ethics and Powers Committee could not convene yesterday as members were attending other parliamentary duties.The Speaker ordered Ms Mdee to return to Dodoma and appear before the Ethics committee following last Wednesday s heated-debate when the House held a special sitting to elect Tanzania s envoys to EALA, whereby, the lawmaker is said to have used offensive language against Mr Ndugai.Vividly incensed by the incidences, Mr Ndugai said Halima s acts were a gross misdemeanor and ordered the police to arrest her and take her to the newlydesignated Capital to face her charges.The speaker told the National Assembly after the question and answer session on Thursday that the Kawe MP has shown irrespective behaviour of the highest degree for quite some time and warned he will not tolerate serial offenders in Parliament.The Speaker also directed Mr Mbowe, who presides as Leader of the Opposition camp in Parliament to appear before the Mkuchika committee immediately following guidance sought by several lawmakers in the wake of the former s abusive language against ruling party, CCM and the government, whom he accused of maliciously voting down Chadema s EALA candidates.Mr Ndugai, reminded the legislators that as head of the House, he will ensure that the National Assembly is conducting its functions by observing rules and regulations, including freedom of speech, but he will not allow such kind of gross misconduct.He told the lawmakers to behave properly because security has been intensified in all areas around Parliament grounds, save for toilets, warning that all people misbehaving and violating the rules and orders will be dealt with accordingly.
