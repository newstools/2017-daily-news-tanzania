Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Legal and Players Status Committee reversed the decision by the federation s 72 Hours Committee to award Simba three points and three goals from their league match which Kagera Sugar won 2-1 on grounds that the Kagera fielded Fakhi who was on three yellow cards.TFF Secretary General, Celestine Mwesiga said the Legal and Players Status Committee overruled the decision after being satisfied the 72 Hours committee made a wrong decision to award Simba victory, and thus, restored Kagera Sugar s points.Mwesiga said the 72 Hours committee meeting lost its legitimacy after non-members were summoned before the committee to give evidence and that according to regulations governing the top flight league, the decision by Legal and Players Status Committee was final.The ruling implies that Simba remain with 59 points from 27 games, three points ahead of reigning champions Young Africans, who have played two games less than their archrivals. On the other hand, Kagera Sugar s successful appeal lifts them above Azam, into third place with 49 points from 26 outings.Meanwhile, The Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) Disciplinary Committee has banned Simba s Head of Information and Communication, Haji Manara for one year from participating in any football activity while slapping him with a 9m/- fine for misconduct.Vice-Chairman of the TFF disciplinary committee Jeremo Msemwa announcing the decisions yesterday, said Manara was found guilty of three offences, including accusing and insulting the country s football governing body, inciting tribalism and interfering with the performance of the federation. Due to all these offences, he is penalised to stay away from football activities for one year and pay a 9m/- fine before the end of his suspension, Msemwa told the media.Msemwa revealed that the committee acted leniently when making its verdict against Manara, who refused to attend the hearing, saying as per disciplinary regulations he should have been handed a five-year ban from football activities, besides paying the 9m/- penalty. Since this was his first offence, the committee used its mandate to reduce the sentence to 12 months, said Msemwa. Mid last week, Manara accused the TFF leadership under Jamal Malinzi of conspiring against his club regarding ongoing regulatory dispute pitting Simba and Kagera Sugar, over erroneous fielding of Mohamed Fakhi when the two teams met in a league match.The Simba official said his club smelled rat in the way the matter was being worked, claiming there was a possible sabotage from some officials who are loyal to their rival club, Young Africans. Manara, who called for Malinzi s resignation, urged the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to investigate the whole case and clear the air.He specifically hit out at Malinzi, claiming the former Young Africans secretary general has been interfering with other independent organs within the TFF in forcing decisions that favour their rivals and that he favoured people from his tribe to take charge of most senior posts in the federation.
