Speaking during a communal Good Friday, mass, which involved practically all churches in Arusha, whose followers gathered at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium here, the clerics warned against the current waves of innuendos, negatively cooked, fabricated reports and other scary rumours, saying they are creating a divided nation and causing people to live in fear.The Bishop for the Northern and Central Diocese of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT), Solomon Masagwa, called upon all Tanzanians to start ignoring, deleting and rebuking those whose only mode of occupation is to create bad news, and distributing them to the masses through social media and online platforms. Even worse, some mainstream media outlets like newspapers, television and radio stations have also started to follow suit, printing and airing fake reports, innuendos and tidings targeting to either mudsling some people, divide the nation, scare some groups or taint the image of the country, the government and its leaders, warned Bishop Masagwa.The Archbishop of the Arusha Catholic Archdiocese, Dr Josaphat Louis Lebulu, said it was high time members of the Christendom faith and Tanzanians stuck to what they believe and maintain their traditional values as being the only weapons to protect them from huge waves of misinformation.The Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Mrisho Gambo, was the special guest at the Good Friday mass congregation organised by the Union of Christendom Churches (Umoja wa Madhehebu), in Arusha and he reminded the followers that the country was in the transition period. You will be hearing a lot from people who find the current changes painful, but under the new leadership of President John Magufuli, the country is being transformed, this is a good development regardless of the pain that some people may feel, stated Mr Gambo.
