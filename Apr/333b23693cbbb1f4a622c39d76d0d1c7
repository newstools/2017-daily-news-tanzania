The company recently announced the introduction of Sophos Mobile 7, the latest version of its Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solution, with the new version extending containerization support for Android Enterprise (formerly Android for Work, ) and enables IT administrators to manage IoT devices and strengthen security features.The General Manager and Senior Vice- President of Sophos, Dan Schiappa, said Sophos Mobile 7 security enhancements include anti-phishing technology to protect users from malicious links in emails and documents and improvements to Sophos Android security and anti-malware app.He said there are also usability enhancements to the Secure Workspace and Secure Email app where users now can open, view and even edit encrypted and secure office format documents and attachments without leaving the secure and encrypted container.He added that Sophos Mobile 7 is the latest in an increasing number of products that are available through the integrated Sophos Central management platform, including the next-generation XG Firewall, Sophos Endpoint Security, Sophos Intercept X, Sophos Email Security, Sophos Server Protection, Sophos Encryption and Sophos Phish Threat. Today, a mobile device is just another endpoint, yet businesses still struggle to manage them within a comprehensive endpoint security strategy due to lack of integration with traditional endpoint protection.The availability of Sophos Mobile 7 alongside other Sophos endpoint, network and encryption protection in Sophos Central will streamline management of mobile devices while increasing security across the entire organization, said Mr Schiappa.He further said the introduction of IoT device management will enable IT organizations to realize the value of IoT projects and help reduce the additional resources required to effectively manage and secure these devices, adding that the development team at Sophos wanted to lead the industry by offering the first steps towards an integrated protection strategy for all devices mobile and IoT.The new IoT functionality will provide basic management features to organizations that are designing and deploying solutions at scale using low-cost Android Things or Windows 10 IoT devices.This includes management tasks such as applying policies, checking the online device status, monitoring battery levels or confirming or updating firmware.Mr Schiappa said Sophos will be one of the first security companies to provide organizations with a cost-efficient way to add management and security capabilities to their IoT projects, offering a communication and management framework that can be built into industrial and commercial IoT solutions such as POS/retail or connected classrooms.
