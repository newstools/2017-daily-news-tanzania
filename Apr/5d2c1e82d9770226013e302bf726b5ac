This fact was once more proved during the recent Eddie Kiddies event. Arusha managed to get nine trophies in the junior tennis tourney held at the Gymkhana Tennis Court here; these includes the Under-18 boys category slot which was won by Emmanuel Mallya and Frank Mshanga in the second position, both from Arusha Gymkhana Tennis Club.The Under 16 boys category was won by Gymkhana again through Kanuti Alagwa and strangely, Esther Nankulange who though a girl was moved to play into the boys slotting because she happened to outperform other girls with greater strides and somehow also the boys slotting needed to be filled up.The Under-14 Boys was won by Rashid Ramadhan from Gymkhana again but the second position went to James Mosses from Kijitonyama Tennis Club of Dar-es-salaam.Kijitonyama Tennis Club managed to get the Under-12 trophy though Stephen Khamis, while the second winner Neel Aggarwal was again from Arusha being a student at the International School of Moshi (ISM), Arusha Campus.The Under-10 age boys trophy went to Braeburn International School of Arusha courtesy of Nicholas Mella.
