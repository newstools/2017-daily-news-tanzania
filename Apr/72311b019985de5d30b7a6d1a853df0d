 We are increasing electric high voltage. The transmission lines in this country have capacity of 220Kv. We are currently installing transmission lines with capacity of 420Kv, which is almost twice the amount of power on demand, the minister said, responding to Lucy Owenya (Special SeatChadema).Giving further details, Prof Muhongo said that installation of power lines from Iringa, Dodoma all through Shinyanga had been completed. That s why, he said, there aren t any power frequent interruptions in those regions because there is enough energy being fed there. Prof Muhongo said these could transmit up to 5,000MW of electricity from Iringa to Shinyanga. In the northern corridor, the minister said his ministry would instal transmission 400Kv lines from Singida to Namanga. Yesterday (Wednesday) I was talking to a contractor, who wants to instal transmission lines from Dar es Salaam and Dodoma. In the western side through Lake Tanganyika, we are in final discussion of installing a high-voltage line of power from Iringa, Sumbawanga, Mpanda, Kigoma and Nyakanazi, he said.The minister also that there was another transmission line being installed and to be launched soon, which would cover the Makambako-Songea stretch, so that Songea District in Ruvuma Region could get looped to the National Grid.He pointed out that most of transmission lines in place were installed way back in 1963. Even in Musoma Urban where he comes from, the minister said, the transmission lines were installed way back in 1963. Now the decision is ours should we cut the power so that we can make changes or remain with the current problems? I think the best answer is that we should remain calm tolerate it, at least for now. The infrastructures are too old that they need to have them replaced is inevitable, the minister appealed.
