The mining area was shut down two years ago by the then Regional Commissioner (RC), Saidi Meck Sadiki, after it was discovered that they were operating contrary to laws and it also posed a risk to the safety of miners.According to an eye witness, Mohamed Seleman, who also works in the same area, it was after lunch around 2 pm on Thursday, this week, when his colleagues kept on working in the pit while he was preparing to join them.Seleman said that after a little while, he heard one of his colleagues screaming. So, he quickly ran to the area to check on what was happening only to find one of his friends partially buried after the pit had collapsed and rushed to excavate him, but he was already injured. I was later joined by one other miner who was in that area and we used our own tools to try and rescue the remaining three but managed to exhume one who was already dead. But, as we were digging, the pit continued to give in and collapsing to such an extent that we failed to carry on with the rescue mission, he narrated.He further said that they had no choice but to abort the mission and rush to report the matter to local government authorities for help, who quickly contacted the District Commissioner (DC) s office for further assistance.The Ilala Regional Police Commander (RPC), Salum Hamduni, confirmed the incident before naming the deceased as Amosi Debwa (28) and the injured as Shaban Mangwala (27). He also said those who are still to be exhumed are Boniface Pius (27) and Rashid Fadhili (28). The situation is still delicate in the area as the pit continues to collapse due to the on-going rains, but we are doing all we can to make sure we rescue the remaining two, he noted.Ilala DC, Sophia Mjema said they were still devising a way an excavator can reach the area to assist them in the rescue mission as the rains are making the area muddy and slippery. This area is not an official mining site, it was shut down two years ago but they kept on doing their activities here against the law.One reason for the closure of this area was a disaster which occurred here in the past, she said. She added that they have also discovered that there was a man in the area who claims to own the quarry mine and has been charging people for conducting activities, but authorities were working on the matter to see how they can solve it once and for all.One of the residents in the area, Ramadhani Chande, said they were all aware of the order imposed by authorities, but it was hard to restrain people from the area as they were looking for money.
