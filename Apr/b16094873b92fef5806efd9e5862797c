The visitors who completed a three-day visit at Gombe National Park have promised to promote it in Israel and the Middle East in general.Speaking in Kigoma shortly after arriving from Gombe National Park, the leader of the group, Ms Ronit Hershkovitz, thanked Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) and the Ministry of Tourism and Natural Resources for organising this visit and Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) for the facilitation.She admitted that the visit has been amazing and a wonderful experience which will remain in their memory for many years to come. Visiting Tanzania has been a great opportunity for us since we have witnessed by ourselves the uniqueness of tourist attractions Tanzania is endowed with including the chimpanzees, indeed, we promise to write and tell our fellow countrymen about the beauty of this country, noted Ronit.Commenting on the journalists in the group, Ms Ronit disclosed that they are from very credible and popular media outlet such as YediotAcharanot -7 Yamim, the weekend magazine of the biggest daily newspaper in Israel, Atmosphere magazine, National Geographic magazine, Channel 2 Television and two popular bloggers and social media practitioners who are also opinion leaders.The visiting team also includes one film actor, a radio and TV celebrity and two senior officials from Safari Company, an Israel based Tour Company. Commenting on the visit the TTB spokesman, Mr Geofrey Tengeneza said that the Board s decision to coordinate this visit is nothing but implementation of strategy to tap on Middle East tourist source market. The Middle East countries are potential tourists source market for Tanzania, so we hardly intend to penetrate into and this is one of the initiatives that we are currently undertaking to fulfil our mission, noted Mr Tengeneza.He added that everyone in the group was very much excited by Gombe visit especially after seeing chimpanzees.He further said that the motive behind taking this group to Gombe National Park is in line with TTB s operations to undertake more promotional drive in southern and western circuits as it has been the case for northern circuit tourist attractions.Mr Tengeneza extended many thanks to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism and TANAPA for their great support rendered to make this visit a success.The team flew from Israel to Zanzibar on April 19 by a charter plane and thereafter connected to Kigoma where they were met at Kigoma Airport by Tanzania Tourist Board s Head of Public Relations Unit, Mr Tengeneza and Gombe Park warden, Mr Elihuruma Wilson, before heading to the park which is 16 kilometres north of Kigoma town on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, the world s second deepest lake.
