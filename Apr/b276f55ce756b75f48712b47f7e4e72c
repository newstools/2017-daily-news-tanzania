The chamber said some husbands in the city still embrace outdated cultural values that obstruct their wives from independently doing businesses, particularly those involving trips for selling their goods.In the wake of this, TWCC chairperson, Mariamu Munanka, plans to push the issue of women freedom as the main agenda of the chamber during the coming Mwanza Business Forum scheduled for next Tuesday. Male dominance is still prevalent in the region.This hinders women from becoming self-reliant. They can t travel and leave the families for marketing their products, she said in an interview. In the same vein, she added, the stakeholders should spearhead the awareness campaign among the women over procedures how to export their goods to neighboring countries.She said that TWCC has made efforts in empowering women through helping them look for markets by involving them in various exhibitions. Munanka noted that the majority women are engaging in food processing, tailoring and livestock keeping because these are activities that need small capital.However, Mwanza city has abundant business opportunities which the women can exploit. To enable increased participation of women in business, efforts are needed to persuade and empowering them, she said. She further argued that the agricultural sector, for instance, has attracted few women entrepreneurs because it requires a big capital to put up investment projects.
