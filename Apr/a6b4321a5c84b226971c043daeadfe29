The researchers have already established that one type of the bananas grown in the region was highly rich with in Vitamin A. So far a total of 12 varieties of bananas have been researched on and three varieties indicate to contain a umber of vitamins and the remaining nine varieties mainly from Uganda were highly nutritious and already used in their malnutrition fighting crusade.Speaking to journalists at the research centre after a field visit the Assistant Researcher, Jasmeck Kilangi said that nutritious banana crop found in the region were drought tolerant and disease resistant. This type of banana is very rich in Vitamin A compared to other types of bananas.Nutritious bananas contain vitamins similar to those found in eggs and other nutritious foods vital in improving health of many people and help in our malnutrition fight, he said. The nutritious bananas already established include pisang, papan, tumbago, muracho, biira, pelipita, lai, lahu and apanut. Mr Kilangi added that the nutritious bananas that were in the trial stage were being used in Uganda and other countries as food products as well as cash crop.He said that the research exercise started way back in January, 2015 and was scheduled to be implemented by farmers in two-years time from. The main target was to improve productivity to farmers and promote health to children and the public at large. If farmers will be engaged in the research process, they will have chance and make decision on the types they would prefer to develop in their fields that could cope with the environment and climate in the production areas, he said.Mr Kilangi added that through this research the parents will be able to control malnutrition that has succumbed their children for years especially in rural areas as most of them cannot afford to buy nutritious foods.He said neighbouring countries that had already been using nutritious bananas include Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda , Kenya and Congo where positive changes occurred and improved food production. He called on government to collaborate with researchers and the general public by supporting their efforts in ensuring nutritious bananas cultivation is developed and expanded to other areas suitable in order to curb the malnutrition. This is the right time to researchers to collaborate with government in conducting these types of research in order to help the country to control various challenges especially stunting and malnutrition that affect many Tanzanians, he insisted.
