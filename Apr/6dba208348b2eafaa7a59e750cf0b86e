The Head of Water Safety, Food Safety and Environmental Sanitation Unit at the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Mr Stephen Kiberiti, made the observation during the preparation for the action plan of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in schools. It s high time that the establishment of new schools in the country considers several factors, including availability of all proper infrastructures such as toilet holes and private rooms for girls, said Mr Kiberiti. He pointed out that lack of such important facilities may expose the children to health risks and affect their learning.In their recommendation statement which was presented by the Coordinator of WASH in Geita Region, Mr Kaitila Mafwimbo, they noted that the situation puts 89 percent of children at risk of infectious diseases and injuries, therefore impacts the quality of education in the country. Girls in the puberty stage are losing 50 days in learning because they lack menstrual hygiene management facilities in schools, noted Mr Kafwimbo. He said that in the capacity of the country, the problem can be solved through joint efforts between the government and members of the community. What is required to solve the problems is proper guidelines and directions to be initiated in our communities to make it happen, he observed. He however cited other interventions as community ownership of the problem and collaborative efforts between stakeholders.To curb the problem of proper hygiene and sanitation, Priss Company Limited has come up with a mechanical hand washing machine which allows use without having to touch for water to come out. According to the CEO of the company, Mr Priss Andrew, the gadget is aimed at stopping transmission of diseases from one person to another. Among other things, the machine is economical, userfriendly, durable and movable, it has gained approval by the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA), pointed out Mr Andrew.
