. These pupils, from 11 public schools in Dear es Salaam, will hold this celebration, at the National Museum and House of Culture, here in the City Centre. The festivities , which include an exhibition, was prepared in collaboration with the Jane Goodall s Roots and Shoots (R&amp;S) organisation,under this year s theme of Connecting People to Nature . The aim for having these festivities and exhibition, is to promote public understanding and perception, on how the present generation inherited the natural world, of which each one now is hoping to pass it onto future generations, the R&amp;S s Coordinator, Japhet Mwanang ombe, explained yesterday.He went on to say that the Kids Nature Festival and Open Exhibition , is a first of its kind, which has been organised to provide opportunities for local children to demonstrate their discovery and cognitive abilities to transform nature and environment conservation education to the public.It also provides a suitable way, he added to promote children s talents by demonstrating important values of the environment to their own lives. This is apart from providing us new vision of engaging directly the public to take-up active roles towards nature and environmental conservation, using children handson works, he added.By using this forum, Mwanang ombe maintains, children have the opportunity to demonstrate, exhibit, share and exchange knowledge, skills, experience and passion that is significantly needed for education and sustainable development.The different themes of the exhibition are designed to address sustainable energy alternatives, conservation agriculture, biomass restoration, tree planting, recycling, compost gardening, soil conservation and mangrove conservation.There will also be children theatre performances, in which schools with different themes will perform through traditional dance, choir, drama, poems and acrobatics. All of these will be aiming at using the power of culture to bring about positive changes in this environment.In this case, Mwanang ombe maintains young people should not complain or remain separated from the mess . This is because he says, they still have time to make positive changes to happen for themselves and the generations to come.The organisers are hoping next year they ll be able to hold this exhibition in other parts of the country.They have requested the presence of the Deputy Minister of Education, Science and Technology, Stella Manyanya, to officially open it. The Earth Day, marked on April 22, is observed worldwide with rallies, conferences, outdoor activities and service projects.
