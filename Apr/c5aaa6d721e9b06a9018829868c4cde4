They started the programme last year and are set to graduate in July, this year. The incubation programme enables upcoming entrepreneurs to receive business and technical support, coaching and linkages to markets and financial institutions to expand their businesses, Dr Olomi stated.He explained further that estimates indicate that there are over three million micro and small businesses in Tanzania, a large chunk of them in the informal sector and employing less than five people.

My company deals in installation of solar power systems, we started as a small company without an office and just two people; I now employ eight people and we have our own offices, he explained.Through technical and financial support, Mr Tarimo said his company has expanded quickly and now serves large consumers unlike in the past when it dealt mostly with individual housing units.
