Country Director of Floresta, a non-governmental organisation, Richard Mhina, whose organisation coordinated the tree planting on April 1, said here over the weekend that the transgressors uprooted over 2,000 trees around Fuka River and other water sources.He decried the environmental degradation trend that is frustrating environmental conservation and poverty reduction efforts, describing it as unbelievable that after so much awareness raising campaigns in the country, people could still indiscriminately uproot trees.Mr Mhina asked the authorities to take swift measures to reverse the trend and allow the law to take its course, warning that the effects of environmental degradation and climate change are non-discriminatory, affecting all living organisms.He said on the National Tree Planting Day this year, in collaboration with citizens, over 8,000 tree were planted around Fuka River and other water sources, as it has been traditional to celebrate the day through planting trees.
