Calling for love and unity in the country, clerics from different religions performed prayers held at the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) head office- Kisiwandui in the Stone Town, where the grave lies beside a monument. We pray for peace, stability and good health for our serving leaders. Unity, love, and peace are things that Karume left for us, we must nurture them, emphasised the clerics during the prayers also attended by prominent women led by First Lady Mwanamwema Shein.Retired leaders Dr Mohammed Gharib Bilal (former Vice-President); Mzee Ali Hassan Mwinyi (former Union President) and Dr Aman Karume (former Zanzibar President), political leaders and family members of the late Karume led by his widow Fatma Karume also attended the prayers.Addressing the gathering after the laying wreaths of flowers at the grave, religious leaders further called upon Tanzanians to pray and honour people who fought for independence led by the late Karume and Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.The late Abeid Karume was assassinated on April 7, 1972 while playing bao game and he is widely remembered for working together with Nyerere to create union and providing people with land for farming, free education and health.Meanwhile, improved quality of cloves, standard processing and good services have prompted the Global Trade Leaders Club to confer the International trophy for Quality product to Zanzibar State Trade Corporation (ZSTC) at a conference held in Paris France.
