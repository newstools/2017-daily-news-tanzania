Speaking to the Sunday News on Friday, the Commissioner of Insurance from Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority (TIRA), Dr Baghayo Saqware, said he is determined to increase awareness campaigns and education programmes that will influence people to know the importance of insurance and hence increase revenues.To counter the problem of low knowledge on insurance, National Insurance Education Strategy (NIES) 2016-2020 was designed to make sure people are informed about the importance of insurance. This strategy will provide an opportunity to raise public awareness at various levels, including primary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, religious organisations and various social groups. The Authority is in the process of negotiating with FSDT so that it can fund the efforts.TIRA, however, is in contact with the Ministry of Finance so that we can get a clearance letter to get the money to implement this strategy, he revealed.According to him, plans are afoot to make sure insurance education is included in school curriculums and be taught from secondary to university levels. The industry has significant importance in contributing to national income if it is effectively utilised, he noted with concern.Dr Saqware pointed out that lack of National Policy on Insurance is a major challenge to the insurance sector, adding that a draft policy is now with the Ministry of Finance being amended before being handed over for implementation.He said that the policy will bring in major reforms in the sector because it will facilitate the establishment of agriculture and livestock insurance, personal pension insurance and insurance that adheres to Islamic law. He tasked insurers to make sure the industry gives enough education to its members and ordinary citizens.Last week, the new TIRA boss directed insurers to extend their service coverage to informal sector in order to boost the industrialisation agenda of the country. Do justice to the industry by serving the larger uncovered population. Expand your products to accommodate people in the informal sector and most importantly, you must carry innovation with you to serve the general public, said Dr Saqware. Expounding further, the Commissioner reminded Association of Tanzania Insurers (ATI) members to increase underwriting capacity which will enhance increase in insurance sector contribution to the national income.
