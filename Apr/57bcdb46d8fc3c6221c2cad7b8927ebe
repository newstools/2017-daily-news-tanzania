As requested, the Guest of Honour, Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan, was present to officially open the four-day France-Tanzania Business Forum, by cutting a ribbon together with her host, the resident French Ambassador, Malika Berak, at the National Museum and House of Culture.In her address to those present, before cutting the decorated ribbon, of both countries colours the VP had much words of thanks to Ambassador Berak and her team for making the event a reality.Then, the two went around to see the exhibits, under the direction of the Secretary General of the Architecture (by) France (AFEX), Madeleine Houbart, who is the curator of the exhibition.When the latter had finished guiding the VP around the Daily News took hold of an available opportunity to find out more about the exhibition and exhibits from her. The Paris based Houbartis, the one who directs this French association - AFEX - which works outside of its Paris base.The fact that she is not an architect she says makes her better suited for these duties because it s easier for her to work for all 200 members without bias. I m very happy working for them to do what they have to do - architecture -which I love, better, she replied, making sure to clear-up any misconceptions there might have been.Houbart referred to members of the association as falling into a special category for a number of reasons. Primarily the actual work they do is different from what they do in France.Further, the rules under which they have to operate are also different, just as the situation or context is. She talked about them having to learn much about the others, to be able to do their work and finally bring back home a lot of interested new ideas. It s just a group of architects, who wanted to be together to go overseas because it s easier when you re a team, as opposed to being alone, she said.For a long while in the past, China was the first place where they exported French architecture, she explained, for various reasons but of late they are very much involved in Africa.They want to work together with local architects. The fact that Africa is growing very fast she says means it needs whatever help available. Currently, she believes lo cal architects are needed here to work on the urban level.She supported her advice on the VP s having mentioned having a local need for roads specifically and infrastructure generally. According to Houbart architects, together with urban planners in France, they are very much involved in the question of mobility. As long as our planet has to become sustainable, we really have to work together and Africa is a real challenge for us all, Houbart suggested. On a personal note, she admitted hopping the four-day exhibition, which ends tomorrow (Thursday), would help locals to know French architecture better.Next it would help build partnerships so that both countries can work to gether on building, planning and mobility, which are the sectors she feels they re good in, therefore, have something to share with any interested party here.It is for this reason that yesterday (Tuesday) there was a scheduled Round Table on Infrastructure Financing at which the visiting Houbart is pleased a lot of students from the Ardhi University are participating.She is pleased because the young people she says are the future and the people they would like working with when the time comes. Although they exhibits total 50 pieces because of the restriction of space, a little more than 30 have been exhibited here.The entire 50 exhibits, she said, had just finished an exhibition in Paris for 10 weeks and is supposed to move onto four other countries - Mongolia, Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Iran.She also told the Daily News that the association is financed by members yearly contribution and receives some additional support from their government.Actually, it was the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs who invited them to bring the exhibition here, so as to participate in the four-day Business Forum for which they covered all their expenses.Seeing that the French ministry of Culture also contributed to the exhibition coming here, the Daily News thought it applicable to get a word from the locally-based Head of Cooperation and Cultural Affairs, Philippe Boncour, as to why they thought it was a valid addition in the Forum.He had no qualms and explained how architecture has to do with culture and economy. Therefore, for them, the development of Dar es Salaam and other cities in the country would definitely involve architects and urban planners.That being the case, they saw it as important for them to showcase what French architects can do. He then explained how they were physically putting this into operation, apart from the exhibition. We have invited a number of students from the Ardhi University together with professors and teachers to a round table because we would like sustainable architecture to become part of the line of reasoning when it s about urban planning. As you can see in Dar es Salaam, there are many new buildings but only few of them actually take into account local material or natural air conditioning, he stated.These kind of techniques Boncour maintains are less expensive than the ones that are being currently used.However, they have not made their way to the mindset of the people. They believe having the exhibition and the round table will help redress this, which they see as an abnormality.
