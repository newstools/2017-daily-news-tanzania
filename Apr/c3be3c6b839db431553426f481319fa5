The four-day annual tournament draws national team players from East Africa. Lambart Rwehula, the Acting Publicity Secretary of Tanzania Darts Association (TADA) told the Sunday News in Dar es Salaam yesterday that preparations for the event were on top gear.He, however, added that the association was yet to get sponsors who will back the team s trip to Kigali. We are looking for sponsors as association has no funds to send the national team to Rwanda, said Rwehula.He added that TADA is looking for about 21m/- to foot all expenses and allowances of players and officials going to Rwanda. We are asking for support from companies, institutions, individuals and sports well-wishers to come forward and support us, he said. The publicity secretary said that Tanzania has a good team capable of lifting the title, but they need support to fulfil that.He said the door is open for sponsors to come forward and assist TADA and the teams so that they can have a successful mission in Kigali. Furthermore, he said that the event is organised annually and can be hosted by any member of the regional community.The last event was held in Dar es Salaam and Tanzania finished second behind winners Kenya. It s now our turn to win the title after narrowly missing it last year, he claimed.Every country will field four men and two ladies teams who will compete at the team game in a round robin format.
