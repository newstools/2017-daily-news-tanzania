The reminder is meant to ensure that the plastic pipes bears the needed standards according to the projects being carried out by contractors to avoid unnecessary costs.Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS), Building and Construction Testing Materials laboratory Engeneer Stephen Minja, said the bureau has all the needed equipment for testing the plastic pipes, hence people should use it in verifying on the quality of pipes they are using.Moreover, he said, individuals who are going on with construction of their sites should also do so since they might be changing them from time to time if only they fix counterfeit or substandard pipes as a result spending a lot of money, which they could get away with if only they took the sample of the materials to the bureau.He said some of the major projects like the natural gas projects have been testing their pipe with TBS for sustainability and safety of the project. Those doing irrigation projects and water projects should do so, as the life span of the plastic pipe is 100 years but if you have a substandard one you might be forced to change them from now and then which is unnecessary cost, said Eng Minja.According to him, companies and organisations that are involved in major water and gas supplies in various regions, they should make use of the laboratory because they have all needed equipment and technology to verify the quality of plastic rubber pipes using international standards. TBS started to take and test all pipe samples made from plastic pipes, produced both locally and imported, he said, adding that there has been low response from the general public to verify on the quality of their water pipes.Mr Minja cautioned those who are in major water projects and the general public at large that there are unfaithful businessmen and therefore, they must take their products especially pipes for the test to get rid of any loss.
