Tanzania Engineering and Manufacturing Design Organization (TEMDO), which operates from Themi Hills in Arusha, has designed various modes of new manufacturing plants and other types of factories that it intends to construct countrywide and sell to companies or individuals interested in operating them. Some firms, organisations or individuals may be interested to invest in manufacturing factories but many are a little worried about the cost and cumbersome process to build new factories from the scratch. We are here to shoulder the burden for them, said TEMDO Director General Kalutu Koshume.Engineer Koshume stated that should any investor want to run the factory but hesitate to build one, TEMDO will be readily available to help with design and construction of the manufacturing facilities.TEMDO has come up with innovative idea of building special cold storage facilities whose functioning does not rely on electricity, with the aim of aiding health services delivery in rural areas. Morgues are important facilities at hospitals and other health centres for storage of dead bodies when medical intervention fails, but they usually require high-voltage electricity.TEMDO has devised the new type of morgue refrigerators as well as body preservation freezers that use alternative sources of energy, especially solar power. Our products maintain the same quality standard as those manufactured abroad, the only difference is that TEMDO-made freezers can be used off-grid and anywhere in the country, revealed Eng Koshume, stating that the first batch of the environment friendly freezers will be rolled out by June 2017.
