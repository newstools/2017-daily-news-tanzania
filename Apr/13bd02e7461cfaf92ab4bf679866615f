The building that would be constructed within its hospital headquarter will provide necessary prenatal and postnatal services which are not currently available in the district, creating a challenge for women or couples to seek for it from the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), that is far from here.The announcement was made recently by Siha District Commissioner (DC), Mr Onesmo Buswelu while meeting some stakeholders of the envisioned project, and urged also the public to come out in big numbers and to contribute towards the building. He said it was both time consuming and costly for the patients to go for such medical attention outside the district, adding: Even KCMC itself is overwhelmed with its patients and we must solve this problem in our district hospital. An expectant mother from here who requires further medical attention has to be transferred to KCMC or Mawenzi Regional Referral Hospital and these centres are far from here. We have to ensure we complete our project and offer all services under one roof. Mr Buswelu said he was optimistic the project would be completed by July this year with funds also coming from within their workforce and other residents in the district.He said the stakeholders as well as the public are relied upon to contribute funds for the project so that the targeted group are helped fast enough and get reliable services they badly need in medicine.On his side, Acting Medical Officer In-Charge, Dr Christina Guveti said the hospital and such patients have been facing difficulties looking for the assistance in the area in vain, because since the institution has not been able to offer them.He said once the building would be ready, they would provide key services such as major surgery, X-Ray as well as deliveries for pregnant women. Others in the list would include prenatal visits, physical examinations, weight checks and urine sample analysis depending on the stages of pregnancy.Health care providers would also be in a position to carry out blood tests and manage Ultrasound examinations among others to reduce multiple risks associated with pregnancies, Dr Guveti pointed out.He hinted that as for postnatal care, it is usual the first six weeks after birth that is critical to the health and survival of a mother and her newborn and care would be given to them once the building would be ready in the hospital compound, adding: The most vulnerable time for both is during the hours and days after birth.
