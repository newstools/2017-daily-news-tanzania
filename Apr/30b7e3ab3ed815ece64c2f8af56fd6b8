Commenting on the findings of the review, the SAGCOT Board Chairman, Mr Salum Shamte, told reporters in Dar es Salaam recently that the way out of the present challenge, is to transform the local peasants mentality so that they do away with old farming methods and take agriculture as a rewarding business. SAGCOT s stakeholders, he said, believe that subsistence farming is unable to feed Tanzania s present population of 50 people. If we go on like this it will be catastrophic and we need to feed 70 million people in the near future. We have to take action now, he added. He said the SAGCOT team visited all southern regions, but without going into details, he added: We cannot leave peasants on their own, because we have witnessed how bad the situation is.There are various ways to help them make a stride to a higher level. Because of fears of a looming hunger and food shortages, Mr Shamte pointed out, SAGCOT has no option, but to go directly to the peasants and train them to produce plenty of crops, and add value to their crops, besides ensuring that they have access to reliable markets for their produce.In another development, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Dr Charles Tizeba was recently quoted as saying farming productivity has to go up because: when we are talking of building industries, it means our agriculture will have to produce the largest part of the needed raw materials. Dr Tizeba said contributions of the agricultural sector stood a better chance in realising Tanzania s Fifth Phase government, under the captainship of Dr John Pombe Magufuli of turning the country into industrialised economy.He also lauded SAGCOT efforts in transforming farmers from peasant farming to commercial farming in the corridor, saying the government was committed to support the farmers development and growth.The SAGCOT s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Geoffrey Kirenga said the Centre has decided that experience gained so far in working with peasants in the corridor, should be used in other parts of the country, in order to open up new opportunities and solve challenges the peasants are currently facing.However, Mr Kirenga hinted that massive investment has been made in the corridor but industries are not getting enough raw materials.He named the SAGCOT funders as United Republic of Tanzania, UK Aid, USAID, World Bank Group, Norwegian Embassy, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and AGRA and thanked them for the support. SAGCOT has all the reasons to acknowledge the support from our funders who make our activities possible and visible, Mr Kirenga added.
