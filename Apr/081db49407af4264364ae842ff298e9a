This was said yesterday in Mbeya by Kikundi Cha HudumaMajumbani (KIHUMBE) Programmes Manager, Ptolemy Samuel at a function to issue health insurance cards to 200 vulnerable adolescents and young girls.According to Ptolemy, KIHUMBE identified the girls through a tool used to identify adolescents and young girls at risk of HIV infections, unwanted pregnancies and other reproductive health outcomes.He said one of the greatest challenges facing adolescent and young girls in Mbeya region is accessing health services when they fall sick, adding the most of the girls do not have means of earning income since they live with dependents while some have children to look after, but lack resources.He further said things become worse when they or their dependents fall sick as they cannot afford to pay for treatment from their pockets. Lacking means of earning a living and other demands compel adolescents and young girls to indulge themselves in risk behaviors such as selling their bodies for money or service, Ptolemy said.Mr. Ptolemy added that it is from this understanding that KIHUMBE with the support from Henry M. Jackson Foundation Medical Research International- Walter Reed Program through a project called DREAMS decided to identify the vulnerable adolescents and young girls and empower them to run income generating activities, which enabled them eventually to pay for health insurance services.Speaking before issuing the health insurance cards on behalf of the Mbeya Regional Commissioner, Amos Makala, theMbeya Regional Medical Officer (RMO) Dr. SeifBakariMhina hailed KIHUMBE for empowering the girls and encouraging them to enroll into the health insurance scheme.Dr. Mhina said the target group targeted by DREAM project faces many challenges. I have been told that the project focuses on adolescents and young girls who have dropped from school due to various reasons, including school fees, forced marriage or teenage pregnancy, orphans, disabled and those living in abject poverty The RMO said.He by so doing, KIHUMBE aims at ensuring that women and girls, including those most marginalized, are able to participate fully in public life and are free from violence, with equal access to education, economic opportunity, and health care, which will increase their broader economic prosperity.Speaking before the guest of honor, KIHUMBE/ DREAM Project Coordinator, Ana Mcharo said that 29, 337 households were visited during the process of identifying vulnerable adolescents and young girls aged 15-24. Out of the 29, 337 households, a total of 7, 884 adolescents and young girls were identified as being at risk of HIV infections due to various factors, including household poverty.The biggest challenge encountered in the process of implementing the DREAM project, she said, is that KIHUMBE is overwhelmed by the big number of adolescent and young girls needing capacity building on income generating activities, transport cost to and from VETA for girls attending classes at VETA.KIHUMBE is a non-profit making, non-governmental organization (NGO) located in Mbeya, southern highland of Tanzania.
