 The Great Ruaha River ecology is in bad shape. We need fast and immediate intervention to address the situation that is why the task force has all the needed experts from the government and development partners, who have the mandate on policy and administrative decisions, the Vice- President said, before directing the force to come up with means to change the situation.She added, We need a lasting solution over the matter. Gone are the days when we will issue orders without people taking action. I want this task force to work day and night to come up with the best result within a short period. She also advised them to incorporate other stakeholders to develop a culture of accountability and ownership of the ecology in the Great Ruaha River. The 13-member team was tasked to undertake immediate steps and develop innovative strategies to address the situation and will submit its report to the Vice-President next month on recommendations of the best ways to manage environment in the area.The Minister in the Vice- President s Office (Union and Environment), Mr January Makamba, pointed out human activities including agriculture and fishery as major factors for environmental degradation in the Great Ruaha River which supplies 22 per cent of the total flow of the Rufiji catchment system.
