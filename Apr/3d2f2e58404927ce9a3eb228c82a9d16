The minister for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr William Lukuvi, said the dilapidated structures located in urban areas were placed under the Central Government so new modern structures can be erected.Mr William Lukuvi was responding to a basic question from Mr Innocent Bashungwa (Karagwe CCM) who wanted the ministry to direct the National Housing Corporation (NHC) to work with Karagwe Council to build housing units for employees.Mr Bashungwa said when the Central Government took over the structures; about 60 families were left homeless, adding that the Karagwe Council was ready to provide land for the low cost housing units for the workers.Mr Lukuvi who confirmed that the structures are now under the central government said tenants who were already living in the structures should not be evicted but should continue living in the buildings until the government is ready to put up the new structures. Currently experts from my ministry and the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication are mapping out the areas so it can legally be under Central Government and while the exercise is going on President John Magufuli directed that the tenants should continue living in those buildings, he explained.He added that the main objective of the Central Government taking over the buildings is to build new and modern structures that will make the town look beautiful.Earlier responding to the basic question from Special Seats MP Saverina Mwaijage (CUF) deputy minister in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlement Development, Ms Angeline Mabula, said NHC has already conducted a verification exercise to identify houses that are beyond repair and those that need to be repaired.Ms Mwijage sought to know when the government could conduct a verification exercise to identify houses that are beyond repair and if the government will set aside budget for rehabilitation of the houses under NHC.Ms Mabula explained that in the 2016/17 fiscal year NHC set aside 11bn/- for rehabilitation of its housing units and by March this year a total of 2, 451 houses had been repaired.
