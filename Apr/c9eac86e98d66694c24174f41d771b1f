The mini-market popularly known for the presence of used motor vehicle spare parts and building materials, was burnt to ashes at around 22.30 hours on Friday night.The fire also destroyed eight shops and an unspecified number of valuables.The mini-market Vice Chairman, Mr Aloyce Mborro, said that preliminary information shows that the source of the fire has yet to be known claiming that the half an hour delay before the fire brigade arrived has not yet been explained. The brigade, however, failed to extinguish the fire when it arrived.Mr Mborro said smoke was seen billowing from the centre of the market by people (including himself) who were watching a football match at a sports centre near the market.Another victim of this disaster, Mr Salvatore Shio, who lost his shop with commodities whose value has been estimated at more than 30m/- said, maybe the fire source originated from a kitchen owned by food vendors within the market.Mr Shio, who is also among the committee members of the management team of the market explained that there is a tendency by food sellers particularly those who are not careful, use charcoal a source of energy, and place a pot of boiling beans to boil overnight.Mr Shio said this could be the source of the destructive fire. However, none of the night security guard was available during the incident.Mr Shio said they are eight in number. Upon hearing the news some of them fled to Kondoa, Singida and Manyara worrying about their safety. They are afraid of affected traders. Many business owners were seen perplexed while others were shedding tears. Some fainted due the shock caused by the impact.An elderly businesman who owned a shop, Mr Joseph Aloyce Shio, said that he lost his business completely. He possessed loans from several financial institutions and does not know how to repay them.
