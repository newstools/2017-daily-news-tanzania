 A large number of children in the country are born with the problem of Hydrocephalus and Spina bifida caused by the lack of Folic Acid. Most women neglect to take tablets containing these minerals during pregnancy or during preparations to get pregnant, she said.She continued to explain that this problem has been costing our Government a lot of money to bring experts from outside the country to perform surgery and treat children with the problems. Lack of nutrients, iron minerals and Folic Acid costs our government a sum of 8 billion shillings which is almost equal to 2.7 per cent of the national income.So one can see how this problem is affecting all of us. Ms Mtega pointed out that in order to fight the problem, Nutrition Officers would continue to corporate with other stakeholders in providing education to the pregnant women about the importance of eating the right kind of food and taking the supplements.Speaking during the opening of the seminar, Regional Medical Officer Dr Seif Mhina said that despite being one of leading regions in food production in the country, Mbeya Region was facing acute malnutrition and stunting problem of children. Stunting problem in children can be controlled within 1,000 days after the child is born and if no measures are taken within these days the situation becomes uncontrollable , he explained.He added that according to a research conducted in the year 2015, Tanzania has 34 percent of stunting problem while at the regional level 38 percent of children in Mbeya Region faced the stunting problem.Ms Mtega said every year a total of 4,000 children in the country are born with Hydrocephalus and Spina bifida. Poor nutrition in our country has been causing a lot of negative effects in academics and economy fields so more joint efforts to end the problems are needed, she said.
