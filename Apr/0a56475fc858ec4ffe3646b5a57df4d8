Briefing reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday following his recent official tour to the Crater, the Minister of State in the Vice-President s Office (Union Affairs and Environment), Mr January Makamba, said the government had already directed its two research think tanks to seek solutions. The research think tanks have been tasked to seek immediate and long-term solutions for the invasive alien species, he said. Mr Makamba pointed out the researchers would seek solutions for the problem in collaboration with the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) and the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI). Basically the jewel the majestic spectacle that s the Ngorongoro Crater is in serious trouble.As you know, the Crater sits like a bowl from where some of the animals cannot move out of to flee this green desert, he said.The minister noted that the alien species of grass were once removed from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) but later re-emerged to invade the home of the big five, namely, African lion, African elephant, buffalo, African leopard, and rhinoceros. The COSTECH and TAWIRI will help us with solution to kick the alien species out of the Crater, he added.Mr Makamba said animals that are capable of moving out of the crater have limited opportunities for movement and an uncertain destination due to ecosystem fragmentation in which the old Ngorongoro- Serengeti as a unified ecosystem whereby animals can migrate has almost disappeared because of human settlement and activities.On Saturday, the Minister posted on his facebook wall page saying: The new national environment policy that I have just drafted has identified this as a new threat to biodiversity and nation s well-being,
