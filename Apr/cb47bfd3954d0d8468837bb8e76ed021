He also told the government to take necessary measures to ensure such accidents stop recurring across the country.His remarks followed a point of order by Sikonge Legislator, George Kakunda (CCM), who had wished the House suspended all other businesses and, instead, discussed the fate of the missing miners following the accident that occurred on Thursday.It is said that at least six people have been confirmed dead and several others are missing after a wall pit collapsed at Walema mine situated in Kitunda Ward, Sikonge District."It is important for the House to discuss this issue and the resolutions taken to the government for further action," he said.This forced the Chairman of the session today, Mr Zungu to stand up and order the government to act and that it should provide updates on the actions taken to the House.However, Mr Zungu also challenged MPs to help the government by making sure that they educate their people not to venture into illegal mine pits, which significantly pose danger to their lives."It is important for MPs tell their people the truth...we should stop always be bound to think about our votes at a time of elections," he said.
