We are continuing with the process of paying the outstanding arrears, allowances and salaries for the teachers, and we are committed to ensure all the arrears are settled soon, he said.Dr Akwilapo called for teachers countrywide to now embark on serious teaching and avoid dodging classes, resulting in low quality teaching on bases of not being paid or claiming their pay from the government.He also asked the Tanzania Teachers Union (TTU) to stop campaigns countrywide that encouraged teachers to down their tools and demanded for their payment from the government.He said the teachers union should now start enhancing teachers to ensure quality teaching, adhering to rules and regulations, expressing the need for the education quality assurances to review the monitoring system in schools to ensure better teaching and learning processes in schools.Dr Akwilapo said the quality assurance should make sure teachers who do not adhere to school rules and regulations, with poor school attendance records and low quality teaching are exposed for disciplinary actions.On the other hand, the Coordinator of Tanzania Education Network (TenMet) Ms Catherine Sekwao asked the government to budget sizeable amount of funding in the education sector in the country.Ms Catherine said that many schools in the country were facing many challenges, such as lack of enough desks and other vital infrastructures.
