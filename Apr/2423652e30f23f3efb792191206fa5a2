Both sides have everything to play for as reaching the final will be a step closer to winning the Federation Cup, whose winner secures one of the tickets to represent the country in CAF Club competitions.While Simba are mathematically still in with a chance to try and win the Premier League title which goes with a ticket to CAF Champions League, for Azam winning the Fed Cup remain the only passage to continental football next season after being squeezed out of the top flight title race.Azam are 13 and 10 points behind leaders Simba and Young Africans respectively in the league table, thus, placed outside the winning zone. Hence they have to bank on the Federation Cup as their only way to play in the continental second tier, CAF Confederation Cup next season.But are equally desperate to win the Cup and go a step closer in their pursuit for continental football, having sat out of CAF Club competitions for four consecutive years.Despite commanding the top flight log, the Reds chances for league glory were undermined by their failure to fetch maximum points in their three away games in the Lake Zone.Simba managed four points from one win, one draw and one defeat against Mbao, Toto African and Kagera Sugar respectively.The Ice-Cream makers will go into the fixture with their confidence high after coming out on top twice against Simba since the turn of the year.They won 1-0 during this year s Mapinduzi Cup final at Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar, and the Ice Cream makers enjoyed similar result when the two teams faced off in the second round league match.And they will be looking to make it a hat-trick of wins against Simba for the first this weekend but Vice-Captain Himid Mao has already predicted a difficult game as he believes the wounded Simba will come full throttle looking for revenge Don t ever think this third game will be as easier as the previous one that we emerged winners.Simba are making their groundwork (to ensure they win) but I believe we ll have better plans to win the coming game, Mao told the club s official website ahead of the game.The defensive midfielder, who scored a cracker that settled the Mapinduzi Cup final in favour of Azam, remained positive of their chances of instilling yet more pain on their city rivals, Simba.
