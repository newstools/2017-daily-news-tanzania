The dry port is part of an undertaking which Head of State, Dr John Magufuli, made at a joint meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni during his two-day State Visit to Tanzania last February. Dr Magufuli and his Ugandan counterpart agreed to maximize business opportunities that would boost the economies of their two neighbouring countries.In 2016, business between Tanzania and Uganda stood at 178.19bn/-; it now stands at 193.59bn/-, according to Dr Magufuli. The two leaders also agreed to establish a dry port in Mwanza for Ugandan business people only, as well as repairing MV Umoja so that it can ferry goods from Mwanza to Uganda, in order to reduce the cost of transporting cargo.The move was welcomed by his Ugandan counterpart who said it was the second liberation offered by Tanzania to Uganda after the support it offered Uganda in liberating the country from the dictatorial leadership of Idd Amin Dada. I salute the government of Tanzania for the envisaged construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and modernizing the Mwanza port as the services will now be cheaper, faster, more efficient and modern, said Mr Museveni.At the weekend, the Mwanza Region Business Development Officer, Mr Yesaya Sikindene, said already the port experts and regional leaders including Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mongella had visited the site where the dry port will be constructed.However, he said that the cost of the construction was yet to be established, although he remains optimistic that everything was on course. Immediately after construction of the port, it will be easier for the ships to ferry cargo from Mwanza to Uganda in an efficient and effective manner, said Mr Sikindene.During Mr Museveni s visit, Dr Magufuli called for the need to exploit business opportunities to the maximum, urging Ugandan businesspeople, should come and invest in the country and Tanzanian traders to equally explore investment opportunities that are available in Uganda. Apart from the dry port, Tanzania is currently implementing a project for the construction of a Standard Gauge Railway from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza, Isaka, Rwanda and Burundi.In an interview with the Daily News in Mwanza the Mwanza RC said the completion of the Standard Gauge railway would help to maximize business in his region as it will be easier to carry cargo at the fastest and more efficient manner.
