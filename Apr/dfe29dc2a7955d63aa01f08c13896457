Mr Zelothe made the observation here yesterday during a press conference with journalists in his office, adding that he also came to the conclusion after attending a meeting in Lusaka, Zambia recently where he was invited to attend a workshop entitled 361 Degrees Africa which encourages business between Tanzania and Zambia.He said food crops like beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes, and rice as well as smoked fish are abundant in Rukwa Region, and have high demands in Zambia, hence it was high time they exploited the opportunity to improve their livelihoods on their sales.The RC advised the residents who are farmers to form groups or establish Cooperative Societies which can easily help them to improve production of the crops in the region and collectively rule the market with the same voice.He tipped them off that to dominate the foreign market, they should insist and focus on good quality and attractive packaging of the products before exporting them. I will be very happy to see Councils in the region come forward on how to build capacity of our farmers and traders to enable them enter Zambian competitive markets with confidence... also as a regional government, we will struggle with good neighbourliness and partnership environment in the 361 Degrees Africa to help, he pointed out.He said the 361 Degrees Africa is tasked to exhibit commitments on how to improve business climate in the two countries of Tanzania and Zambia, and hence expected them to maximally exploit the situation.The 361 Degrees Africa meeting in Lusaka was officially opened by Tanzania High Commissioner to Zambia, Ms Grace Mujuma, who was reported to have asked traders from Tanzania particularly the ones in Rukwa and Songwe Regions to exploit the chance when it was still green.Rukwa Region is bordered to the north by Katavi Region, and to the east by Songwe Region, to the south by Zambia through Kasesya and Mosi borders. To the west it is bordered by Lake Tanganyika, which forms a border between Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
