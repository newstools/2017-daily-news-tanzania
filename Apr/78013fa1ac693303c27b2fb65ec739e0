Mwanza is a major industrial axis to the Northwest of Tanzania; the city is home to a variety of industrial, manufacturing and processing industries ranging from small to largescale.These include edible oil mills, printing shops, metal workshops, processing plants, soft drinks manufacturing, bottling industries and cosmetics/ soap making factories. Manufacturing industries alone employ about 38 per cent of Mwanza residents, according to Mwanza Master Plan 2008- 28.Processing and beverage industries, for example, employ most of the semi-skilled workforce. The industries are closely linked to the agricultural sector from which they get the raw material.The Mwanza Master Plan is the realization of the government efforts initiated under the leadership of immediate past President Jakaya Kikwete, whose first phase of implementation now takes off effectively under the current administration of Dr John Magufuli.The driving force behind these initiatives, according to Mwanza Urban Planning Officer, Misana Bihemo, has its origins in the need to address the impending challenges emanating from unguided growth of many large urban centres in Tanzania, as indeed, is the case across Africa and the larger developing world.It aims at enhancing culture, natural wealth and unleashing important potentials as highlighted in the goals and objectives of the National Five- Year Development Plan (2016/17- 2020/21). It also complements well with the National Development Vision 2025 that bears the goal of transforming Tanzania from low to a middle income country.Save for the many proposals that have been put forward in this plan, the quest for an increased employment, setting aside adequate land for industrial development, infrastructure development, transport infrastructureand transport facilities, health and education facilities are key components that underpin the major proposals of the national long term plans.
