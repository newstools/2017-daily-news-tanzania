The two organisations have also established a working group of LPGA, PGA Tour, European Tour, Ladies European Tour and PGA of America representatives to immediately begin a comprehensive review of broader video issues that arise in televised competitions, including viewer call-ins.In the joint press release this week that the Daily News had its copy, new decision 34-3/10 implements two standards for rules committees to limit the use of video: (1) when video reveals evidence that could not reasonably be seen with the naked eye and (2) when players use their reasonable judgment to determine a specific location when applying the rules.The first standard states the use of video technology can make it possible to identify things that could not be seen with the naked eye. An example includes a player who unknowingly touches a few grains of sand in taking a backswing with a club in a bunker when making a stroke.If the committee concludes that such facts could not reasonably have been seen with the naked eye and the player was not otherwise aware of the potential breach, the player will be deemed not to have breached the rules, even when video technology shows otherwise.This extends the provision from ball at rest moved cases, which was introduced in 2014 (decision 18/4).
