The convicts are Emmanuel Mosha, Elisha Mollel and Yasin Monday, alias Chale, whom the prosecution described as persons who have been posing as customers and rent some rooms in hotels, but at midnight turned into criminals and robbed genuine customers of their belongings.Principal Resident Magistrate Wilbard Mashauri convicted the three of the offence and ordered each to remain behind bars for 30 years. He said that the court was satisfied by evidence produced by six prosecution witnesses.The magistrate ruled that the prosecution sufficiently proved its case beyond reasonable doubts as required in criminal cases that indeed the three accused persons committed the offence they were charged with.During motivations after being convicted of the offence, the accused had requested the court for mercy, alleging that it was the first time for them to be convicted of criminal offences.However, the prosecution led by State Attorney Adolf Mkini, sought a severe punishment to the convicts considering that the offence under which they were found guilty was serious and that it falls under the Minimum Sentence Act.The court heard that the three stole at gun point 470,000/- in cash, and prepaid airtime vouchers of Airtel, Tigo and Vodacom, valued at 1,135,000/-, all valued at 1,605,000/-, the property of the hotel.Immediately, before and after such stealing they threatened one Happiness Msuman in order to obtain and retain the said items.
