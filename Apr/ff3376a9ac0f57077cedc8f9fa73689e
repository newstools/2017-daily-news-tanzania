In his closing remarks, Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mongella, thanked TSN for co-organizing the grand event together with his office and promised to make sure the region hosts many such occasions in the near future. Thank you TSN, thank you Dr Jim Yonazi for the very successful symposium. You have taught us a lot that we didn t know before and have shown us that it is possible bringing together development stakeholders to make such valuable offerings, he said.It was an overwhelming moment as the Mwanza Business Forum climaxed here on Tuesday with hundreds of participants expressing satisfaction on the fully packed session that opened a new page for the region.At least 15 representatives of the companies, government institutions and business community made their presentations all showcasing a number of opportunities the Mwanza Region could tap and excel in economy.He said the end of the symposium has now opened a room for the arrangement of another event which he planned to be organized every year and hinted on an international investors forum that has been earmarked for Mwanza next year.The RC said he has been informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Augustine Mahiga on the event the first of its kind to be hosted by the upcountry region as such forums have been held in Dar es Salaam in the past.Mr Mongella said an agenda on investment does not only target big companies and enterprises but should be cross cutting and inclusive for every enthusiastic business dealer to take part calling for Mwanza based entrepreneurs to be fully involved.He particularly thanked stakeholders like the Medical Stores Department (MSD) whose Director General had encouraged the region to invite many investors in pharmaceutical industry to come aboard since there were many raw materials like cotton and water ready for the production of supplies like cotton wool's and water drips among others currently being imported.He challenged the banks to rollout education on lending and banking procedures for loan seekers with experience showing many lenders were ignorant of many opportunities as they ask for loans.On manufacturers, the RC asked them to be innovative and observe quality and remain committed on issues pertaining to meeting standards of the products for the sake of profitability.Thanking the participants, the TSN Managing Editor Dr Yonazi said he was happy on seeing Mwanza stakeholders owning the business and investment forum and thanked Mr Mongella for conceiving it to its fantastic end. We all wish to live longer and witness the successes of all good plans and issues we have spent the whole day discussing today. TSN promises to maintain this noble partnership with all the sponsors of these events for future and continuous economic and even academic excellence, he said.Dr Yonazi said TSN will continue organising extended business forums to be rolled out countrywide and asked for more business partners to chip in and sponsor them in a win win situation.
