This was revealed in the August House today by the deputy minister for Home Affairs, Mr Hamad Masauni when responding to Mr Othman Omar Haji (Gando CUF), who wanted know why security organs had not arrested Chama cha Mpandizi (CCM) followers linked to the burning of CUF houses in Tumbatu area in the Isles.Mr Masauni said the police had since completed their investigations, and that the directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) would soon be furnished with the particulars for legal actions. It is true there was conflict after the Zanzibar elections some of the opposition party leaders including the MPs encouraged their followers to engage in disorderly conduct resulting in the burning of farms and houses including that of Zanzibar s commissioner of police, he explained.He noted that police investigations have linked the burning of the commissioner s house to leaders of the opposition CUF, adding that more than 24 people linked with the violence had been arrested within Zanzibar, some of whom had since been arraigned in court -- while others await conclusion of pending investigations. So it is not true that the police are not doing anything whether in Tumbatu, Pemba or elsewhere in the country, he explained.On public rallies, the deputy minister said all political parties are not allowed to stage any save for MPs in their own constituencies. Internal meetings for all political parties are allowed and if the MP has proof of legal meetings of his party that were banned he should avail me proof so the parties responsible are deal with, he explained.Mr Masauni said the police is there to protect the citizens and their Property, not just for the interests of a particular political party. The police work to protect all Tanzanians regardless of their political affiliations, religion or the colour of their skin. However whenever our officers go against these ideals, disciplinary measures are taken, he noted.
