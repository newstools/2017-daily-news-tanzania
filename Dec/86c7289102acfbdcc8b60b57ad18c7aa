The Managing Director of Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB), Ms Devota Mdachi (pictured), made the request here recently, after a group of Tanzanian envoys had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. “Every Tanzanian based overseas should cooperate with our embassies, to promote our attractions. The tourism sector is one of the most dependable in sectors of economy,” she stressed. She said the Fifth Phase Government under the stewardship of President John Magufuli had given the tourism sector top priority, and should thus be given concerted promotional drive from all fronts. Earlier, Tanzania’s Ambassador to Russia, Lt. General Wynjones Kisamba, extended gratitude to TTB for co-ordinating the visit by the envoys to various tourist attractions, as well as climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest in Africa. “We will use the photographs taken during the climb and when reaching to the peak of the mountain to show the world that Tanzania had unique attractions that cannot be found anywhere else,” he said, adding: “Our task ahead now is going to meet our colleagues living abroad and chart out on a joint strategy on how we will cooperate in attracting tourists. We will prepare journals, flyers and promotional materials,” he said. Ambassador Hemedi Mgaza, who is based in Saudi Arabia, said after returning to his work station, he would show people all the photographs taken during the climb. The ambassadors were joined in the tour by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional and International Cooperation and the coordinators, TTB.
