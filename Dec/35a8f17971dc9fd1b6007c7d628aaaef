According to a statement issued by Ms Stella Vuzo, an Information Officer with the Tanzania office of the United Nations, the delegation will be in the country from the 3rd to the 6th of December, “to sensitise the Question of Palestine and the work of the committee.” The Palestinian delegation is expected to have audience with Ambassador Augustine Mahiga, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Corporation today, to be followed by a joint press conference. The guests are scheduled to meet editors and senior reporters from various media houses and hold talks with some Non- Governmental Organisations’ officials tomorrow. The itinerary also includes meetings with members of the academia including political science, law and foreign relations students from different universities in Dar es Salaam, focused on enhancing political and diplomatic ties and Tanzania’s support for the two-state solution. According to Ms Vuzo, the overall objective of the visit is to inform local public opinion about the conditions of life for the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation, as well as the mandate and role of the CEIRPP to garner support on the question of Palestine. The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People is observed by the United Nations on or around 29 November each year, in accordance with the General Assembly mandates contained in resolutions 32/40 B of 2 December 1977, 34/65 D of 12 December 1979, and subsequent resolutions adopted under agenda item “Question of Palestine”. The date 29 November was chosen because of its meaning and significance to the Palestinian People. On that day in 1947, the General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (11), which came to be known as the Partition Resolution.
