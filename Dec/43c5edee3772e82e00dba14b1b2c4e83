Mr Viking and his son, Mr Nguza were sentenced to life imprisonment on February 11, 2010 after they were found guilty of raping and defiling Mashujaa Primary School Children pupils aged between six and ten years in Sinza area, Kinondoni District. The offence was committed in 2003. The announcement by President Magufuli to grant presidential pardon to the two musicians sent almost the whole crowd that attended the celebrations to mark the 56th anniversary of Tanganyikaâ€™s independence in Dodoma into frenzy. The two musicians filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal in 2013 through advocates Mabere Marando and Gabriel Mnyelle, asking the highest court to revisit their sentence but in November, 2013 the sentence was upheld.
