HPSS Chief Technical Service Officer Mr Ally Kebby, says at least 80 percent of hospitals and other health facilities faced a critical shortage of the professional cadre. “We are now partnering with the government to tackle this challenge,” he told reporters at the 8th graduation ceremony of the St John University of Tanzania (SJUT). At least 1,266 students were awarded various academic credentials, including 171 students who were awarded Basic Technical Certificates in Medicine Dispensing. It is a newly introduced course at the 10 year old higher learning institution, and was organised in collaboration with HPSS. Mr Kebby said to start with, the organisation had sponsored 16 students to sharpen their knowledge on medicine dispensing technology. According to the health expert, most hospitals and health facilities had been compelled to organize short courses for their staff, to enable them play the role of medicine dispensing technicians. “This area is very critical. Unqualified attendants had reportedly been dispensing antibiotics contrary to medical procedures; this is a crisis not only to the medical fraternity but the nation at large,” he said, noting that his organisation was now partnering with higher learning institutions to train more technicians. At least 50 more students have been admitted at the institution and an additional 50 drawn from public health institutions would be supported by the organisation during the next academic year. Prof Emmanuel Mbennah, the St John University of Tanzania Vice-Chancellor, acknowledged the support from development partners, parents, students and lecturers.
