The Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office, Policy and Coordination, Professor Faustin Kamuzora, told TNBC workers when he called at their office yesterday that he believes the council could put up a better performance than it is currently doing. “We must ensure investors are happy to do business on Tanzanian soil so that we can collect a lot of taxes and multiply jobs for the youth,” he said adding, “play your part and the government will play its too.” The PS believed that the council has intelligent and capable people to engineer radical changes in doing business in the country. The government will meet part of the running costs and contribute to removing challenges the council is facing, he pledged. TNBC Director of Business Environment, Mr Arthur Mtafya, said the council was established to help the private sector play a positive role during and after the restructuring of the economy. The 40-member council has 20 members from the private sector and another 20 from the government. He said the more productive dialogue between the private and government becomes futile when the number of prospective investors who want to invest in Tanzania increases. The council, he said, has inadequate funds and is unable to meet twice a year as it is obliged to do. Earlier, the TNBC Executive Secretary, Engineer Raymond Mbilinyi, said the council is making preparations for the 11th meeting of the council, adding the PS’ visit has come at the right time. “We had the 10th meeting in May, this year. The recommendations made during the meeting which was chaired by President John Magufuli bore positive results within a very short time,” he said. TNBC was established in 2001 and a sitting president is automatic the council chairman.
