The construction of the project is valued at 1,893,496,725/-, out of which the government has already paid its contractor, Fally Enterprises Limited 1,407,127, 880/- , leaving only 486,368, 845/- and yet all its 33 water points are not functioning. The Deputy Minister for Water, Mr Jumaa Aweso (pictured), who is in Rukwa Region on a working tour, uncovered the negligence and rot of the stalled water project which has already consumed tax payersâ€™ money. While inspecting the water project at the small town of Laela in Sumbawanga District late Friday, the Laela Township Executive Officer (TEO), Mr Henry Haule, told the deputy minister that upon completion, the water project will benefit about 21,068 residents. He confessed before the deputy minister that since its completion two years ago, citizens from the area got supply of water for only a week before all 33 water points went dry. The Project Consultant, Mr Anold Mbaruk, told Mr Aweso that the project officially kicked off on November 2015 and was completed on February 2016 by 95 by cent. However, Mr Aweso during his inspection of the water project discovered that the contractor used substandard material imported from Italy which failed to work and was informed that the same materials have been ordered from the same country and are expected to arrive in the country early next year. However, Mr Aweso was vividly irked after discovering that one Vedastus Charles lied to him that he was the main contractor of the water project, but after being grilled the latter admitted that he was not qualified to supervise the project. Mr Charles who earlier told the deputy minister that he holds a Water and Sanitation Engineering Diploma, later confessed that he was not the project contractor and that he was simply a representative. The deputy minister directed the Sumbawanga Acting District Commissioner (DC), Mr Said Mtanda, to investigate the officers from Sumbawanga District Council who are supposed to supervise the project, claiming that some of them are dishonest and are colluding with the constructors and consultants.
