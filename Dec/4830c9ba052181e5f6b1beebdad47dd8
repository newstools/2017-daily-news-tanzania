Rukwa Regional Coordinator for TACAIDS, Daniel Mwaiteleke revealed this during a training session on HIV/AIDs at the work place held here yesterday and funded by Walter Reeds. “This is the good news and very encouraging, indeed, but more efforts are needed to address the situation in efforts to attain ‘zero per cent’ … the prevalence rate in Rukwa now is below to national HIV/AIDS figures … it has dropped from 5.7 per cent to 4.7 per cent, “ added Mwaiteleke. “The decline on infections rate does not mean that HIV/AIDS has been stamped out, but that it is the result of efforts undertaken by the government in collaboration with other stakeholders, including citizens in Rukwa region taking preventive measures against new infections “The findings are a result of joint efforts between the government, citizens and different stakeholders who have concentrated on creating public awareness and services on HIV/AIDS issues,” added Mr Mwaiteleke. According to the country’s HIV/AIDS Indicator Survey, the rate of prevalence within Rukwa region stood at 6.0 per cent in 2014, which has since dropped to 4.5 per cent to date.
