The cement manufacturer also won against other entities on the manufacturing category. “As a leading producer of cement, our most top priority is on quality. We put quality above the rest... and these awards can bear witness,” Tanga Cement Financial controller, Isaac Lupokela said. He said that the company has been the winner for the second year consecutively. This creates the much-needed trust when the company wants to conduct business with local and international investors. “The good thing is that the company has a very healthy relationship with the government. We will be hand in hand with President Magufuli to make sure that we realize our long awaited dream of making Tanzania an industrialized country.” The State’s Accountant General, Francis Mwakapalila, who presided over the event as the chief guest, said that heading towards industrialized nation, transparency is the best shot to take. He urged companies to embrace transparency in their undertakings so as to create mutual benefit to investors and the government. The award seeks to promote integrated reporting through enhancing accountability, transparency and integrity in compliance with appropriate financial reporting framework, according to the National Board of Accountants and Auditors (NBAA). The awards are presented annually by the board to various public and private institutions and companies which have consistently maintained the required financial records. The NBAA Executive Director, Pius Maneno, said during a gala here on Saturday that increased participation by the public sector underpins the commitment to more open accountability in the use of public funds and offers the entities an opportunity to be assessed against global standards.
