The Deputy Minister made the call yesterday when he toured Kaoline Industry and the much -protected Kazimzumbwi and Pugu Forest Reserves, in Kisarawe District, Coast Region. Mr Hasunga said the government was not ready to see forest reserves being encroached by residents living around them. Likewise, he said it was strictly prohibited for cattle or any other domestic animals to graze in the reserves. “There is a pressing for us and the public in general to strengthen tourism. Tourists are fond of nature, including forests that make part of tourist attractions,” the deputy minister stressed. The ministerial government official asked Kisarawe District residents to explore avenues that may be turned into tourist attractions, including improving them to attract more tourists. Acting Kisarawe District forest manager, Mathew Mwanuo informed the deputy minister that Kisarawe had four forest reserves managed by the central government. He mentioned them as Ruvu South, Masanganya, Pugu and Kazimzumbwi. According to Mr Mwanuo, Kazimzumbwi forest reserve had constantly been invaded by residents from various areas, including Dar es Salaam and its environs. “This forest was severely affected after residents invaded it between 1993 and 2014. Despite efforts to protect it invaders have been able to find loopholes to invade it in search of forest products even this year,” he said. He said as part of the efforts to protect the reserve, Mr Mwanuo said, Kisarawe District Defense and Security Committee in collaboration with officials from Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS), with effect from August this years, conducted a special campaign and crackdown to remove all the invaders.
