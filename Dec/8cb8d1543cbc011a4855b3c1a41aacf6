The new inspection report which was unveiled during a stakeholders’ meeting held in Dar es Salaam indicates that there was considerable increase in number of containers following extension of grace period for transit cargo before demurrage charges. The situation has compelled stakeholders to appeal to the Tanzania International Container Terminal Services (TICTS) to increase efficiency in cargo handling at the Port. In an interview with the ‘Daily News’ yesterday, Secretary General of the Tanzania Freight Forwarders Association (TAFFA), Mr Tony Swai, said TICTS should invest more in facilities used to clear cargo and avoid delays. “With inadequate facilities, TICTS has been overwhelmed with increased number of cargo at the Port,” he said, noting for instance that it takes about 12 hours for a truck to reach gate No.8 due to long queues. Mr Swai also raised concern that there were unnecessary delays on obtaining Delivery Orders and Container Storing Order. The inspection report quoted a TICTS official admitting the problem of truck congestion due to increased transit containers. But, the report further shows that though the increased cargo could be the factor, the malfunctioning of some of the machineries to clear the cargo could also be the reason. For example, the inspection established that some Round Tire Ground Cranes (RTG’s) were not functioning. “Such equipment would have helped to lower down the temperature had they been deployed during the peak of the crisis,” the report says. It was suggested that the terminals must invest in additional automated stacking cranes. Furthermore, terminal operators will need to expand or change their operations to provide additional staging areas within the terminal area that meet commercial needs if the current status of retaining transit cargo is maintained. On the other hand, it was crucial to sensitize agents on timely clearance of transit cargo and avert turning the terminal into storage facility.
