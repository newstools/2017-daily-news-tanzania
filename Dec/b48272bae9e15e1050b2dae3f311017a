Petro named other athletes included in JKT team as Fabian Joseph, Emmanuel Giniki, Joseph Panga, Stephano Huche and Yonaha Sulle, while ladies are Angelina Tsere, Myselina Mbua Secia Panga. He said this year’s festival has been sponsored by Olympic Solidarity, through the Tanzania Olympic Committee (TOC) and Filbert Bayi Foundation (FBF). Adding, Petro said the 10km race for both men and women is likely to be very tough this year as many notable runners from Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Manyara regions have confirmed to vie for the event’s top prizes. Manyara Region is renowned for producing long distance runners and among them is Filbert Bayi, the first Tanzanian to break two world records in 800m and 1500m races. TOC Secretary General, Filbert Bayi, said Shonza will represent the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Harrison Mwakyembe. Bayi said this year’s festival will also see cyclists compete in a gruelling 60 km race for men and 30 km for ladies.
