The annual Open tournament is scheduled to tee off at the 18 holes par 72 course this Sunday. Lugalo Captain Japhet Masai told the ‘Daily News’ in Dar es Salaam yesterday that all is going well for the club to host the event. Masai said the tournament that is meant to commemorate the country’s 56th Independence Anniversary, is organised by the club in collaboration with EAG Group Limited and Wihab Group. “I want to invite all golfers to come forward and take part at 2017 Uhuru Golf Cup,” he said. Masai added that the tournament was open for men’s Division A, B and C, ladies, seniors, juniors and caddies. He insisted: “It is going to be a wonderful event and as we approach to the end of the year... it is good for golfers to come together before the festive season.” The captain said that fabulous prizes are for grab by winners during the event, which include television set, bicycle and mobile phones. According to Masai, the event is sponsored by the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA), CSSRA and WiA Group. He thanked all sponsors for making it possible to organise the event. He said the tournament was to be staged on Sunday to pave way for the East African Community (EAC) Inter- Parliament Game golf event taking place on Saturday. “We are delighted to host EAC members of parliaments at our course on Saturday before Sunday’s Uhuru Cup,” he said. He added that this is going to be a memorable weekend as two important events will colour the club.
