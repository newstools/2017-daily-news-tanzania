PKF, Partner Mustansir Gulamhussein told this paper yesterday that the plan is to reach as many businesses so that they can be conversant with different taxes, an initiative that will assist the Government collect its taxes smoothly. “We have conducted a seminar in Mwanza and it was very successful. We started in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and will move on to other regions to make sure that businesses become aware of tax laws and other related information about taxes and labour,” he said. According to Gulamhussein, there are several tax changes in 2017, thus PKF realized that there is a need to educate people on the amendments and key compliance matters pertaining to their business. “The finance Act 2017came into effect on 1st July this year, setting out various amendments and guidelines on tax regimes affecting businesses across Tanzania. It’s high time to educate society about those changes,” he said. He said PKF developed the interest to conduct tax education training after realizing that majority of business people are not conversant with tax and labour laws in the country. It is important that “Taxpayer” to be conversant with key aspects of tax and labour laws, which affect their businesses on a daily basis. This will indeed provide Tax Payers with an understanding of their obligation to pay tax and their rights thereto. That’s why PKF saw that this kind of training is relevant to the business community in the country. Our plan is to reach as many Tanzanians as we can so that we support Government efforts in tax collection,” he said.
