The call was issued by Mr Khamis Daud Simba, Director for Cooperatives in the Ministry of Empowerment, Cooperatives, Social Welfare, Youths, Children and Women Development, during a Microfinance Stakeholders meeting held here recently. “The government’s ambition is to move towards middle-income industrial economy by the year 2025, the modern economy is characterized by industrialisation and to achieve that we must promote the production sector,” he said. He said micro-finance institutions should support the government’s vision by enabling their members establish small and middle factories and take part in the production of raw materials for the industries. “The production sector is key towards achieving the industrial objective…we should all contribute in building industrial economy,” he said, noting that developing and managing business venture should be the focus among graduates. Mr Simba noted that almost 700,000 youth getting into the labour market annually but only very few of them were being employed by the government; hence, it was important to develop the private sector. He added that the microfinance play a significance role in empowering youth entrepreneurs by providing them with capitals to start or develop their businesses. “The industrial economy requires four things; manpower, education, both professional and entrepreneurial, land and capital. Without capital all other areas will paralyze,” the Director asserted. The Tanzania Association of Microfinance Institutions (TAMFI) organized the meeting with a view to familiarize with Zanzibar stakeholders in the sector. TAMFI Program Officer, Mr Joshua John said the association, which is the umbrella organization for micro-finance institutions in Tanzania, was committed to promoting activities which enhance the growth of micro-finance sector and contribute towards poverty eradication across the country.
