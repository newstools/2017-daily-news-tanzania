The bank order was issued mid last week and sent to 77 defaulters most of them owning houses in Dar es Salaam. The notice said the bank notified lenders and their guarantors that those who failed to settle their debts would have their houses auctioned. “...The bank shall sell the said properties that were deposited as collateral though an open auction,” the notice published on ‘HabariLeo’ showed. According to the notice, 90 per cent of the properties risking to be auctioned are in Dar es Salaam, and seven are in the Coast Region. This seems the first time a bank intends to auction the defaulters’ properties at a go after borrowers failed to settle their dues.
