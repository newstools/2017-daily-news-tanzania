RPC Mohamed named the fallen officer as D/C Ephrain Lazaro Fredy (aged about 32), who was part of a team of law enforcers that was searching for the bandit in Irimba area in the district . “ We will be paying last respects to officer this evening and thereafter, his body will be transported to Iringa Region for burial,“ the RPC told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone. Police officers who were with the deceased subsequently shot the suspected hardcore bandit identified as Mbogo James, commonly known as Mchina, according to ACP Momahed. “When the police officers approached the house of the bandit it seems he ( Mchina) saw them and fired at them, in the course of which he injured the officer who died while he was being rushed to hospital. But his colleagues shot and injured the bandit, who died due to excessive bleeding in a nearby bush,” the RPC explained. ACP Momahed said police officers had been deployed to the scene to search for the gun used by the bandit whom he described as very dangerous, and had been engaged in serious crimes. The suspected bandit, he said, had been facing armed robbery charges at a court in Musoma but had escaped last month. “He was facing charges related to armed robbery and illegal possession of firearms. He escaped in November and we were looking for him in his house in Butiama District, in pursuit of a tip-off”, the RPC said .
