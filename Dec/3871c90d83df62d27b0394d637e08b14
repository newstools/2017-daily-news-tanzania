The Minister of State, President’s Office (Public Administration and Good Governance), Mr George Mkuchika, said despite registering the said success, efforts are being done to cover the remaining 30 per cent. The target, he said when receiving Tanga’s TASAF III report, was to cover the 30 per cent before the current government tenure end. Mr Mkuchika said the programme faced myriads of challenges, the main one is unfaithful local government officers registering unqualified beneficiaries. "I direct all executive directors and officers of towns, districts, municipalities of all regions to sack or take legal measures to all unfaithful (TASAF) coordinators prior to my tour of duty," he said. Mr Mkuchika was in Tanga for a one-day official tour of the region. The minister, among other duties, received the region TASAF III report. Earlier while presenting the report, Tanga Region Administrative Secretary, Eng Zena Saidi, said a total of 30.41bn/- has been disbursed to 55,703 households under TASAF III project in the region.
