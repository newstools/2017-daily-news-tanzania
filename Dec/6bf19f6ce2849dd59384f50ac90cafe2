As a result, luxury properties located within the city have been permitted to shoot fireworks on condition that the whole exercise should not take more than three minutes, and the explosions in the sky must not last more than five minutes. “As you know fireworks make loud explosions and it will be difficult for the police on patrol to trace criminals who are notorious of taking advantage of such commotion to commit crime,” explained the Regional Police Commander (RPC), Mr Charles Mkumbo (pictured) here. The RPC stated that since tourists’ hotels are packed with foreign guests who have come to spend New Year in Arusha, they want to provide some excitement to the visitors, that is why they have been allowed to shoot the fireworks for a few minutes. The police have also maintained their stand against tire burning episodes usually conducted by unruly youth as part of the New Year stints in the city. “Tire burning is not only dangerous to motorists, but they also damage the infrastructure, and therefore, this year we have decided to involve Municipal Authorities as well as the Tanzania Roads Network Agency (TANROADS) to deal with the culprits who set fire on roads,” said the RPC. He said that people caught setting tires ablaze will be subjected to pay heavy fines, including repairing the damaged parts of the road. Still, Arusha has remained almost deserted this holiday season as many of the city residents travelled upcountry to celebrate with relatives and loved ones.
