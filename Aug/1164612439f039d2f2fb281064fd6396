The Daily News, HabariLeo and SpotiLeo received the numbered licences at the Tanzania Information Services (MAELEZO) in Dar es Salaam just a week after the government issued a directive to all print media to re-register their outlets by October 15 this year.The newspapers were, respectively, given licence numbers two (Daily News) three (Habari Leo) and four (SpotiLeo). Nchi Yetu Tanzania, a magazine published by the MAELEZO, was given licence number one.Shortly after handing over the licences, the Director General of Information Services and Government Chief Spokesperson, Dr Hassan Abbasi, said that the government had re-registered the four newspapers after meeting all requirements needed under the law. I congratulate the TSN for being proactive as it managed to meet all requirements within three days after issuance of the directive, he said, noting, This should serve as lesson to others not to wait until close to the deadline. For the TSN to meet the requirements and receive the licences within a few days proves that there is no nepotism in this exercise, he remarked.The TSN Managing Editor, Dr Jim Yonazi, said the company was pleased with the whole exercise and becoming among the first receivers of the licences. We still have more plans and strategies to ensure that we continue to lead in the media industry, he said, adding that the new registration will bring more impact to the company as it eyes to introduce new products for its newspapers.
