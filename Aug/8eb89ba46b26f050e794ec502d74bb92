From the meeting held at Mwalimu Julius Nyerere International Conference Centre Dar es Salaam yesterday, the club will now see its shares being sold and individually owned by people. Also, the transformations will see, 50 per cent of the club being controlled by its members while the remaining 50 per cent will be possessed by the sponsors.The sponsors will have to invest 20bn/- similar to the club members who shall be required to pump in 4bn/- equivalent to 10 per cent while the remaining 40 per cent similar to 16bn/- will be sourced basing on the ability of the team s members since most of them are financially unstable. In terms of who will be the sponsors, a committee will be convened whose main job will be to identify the right candidate for the post.Among the key figure in the yesterday s meeting were the Deputy Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children, Hamis Kigwangala, Acting Club President, Salim Abdallah and his vice Iddi Kajuna. Others were club s sponsors Ramesh Patel, Adam Mgoyi and Juma Kapuya while the Vice- President of the football governing body (TFF), Michael Wambura, attended as a club member.On August 1, 2016, businessman Mohamed Dewji officially tabled his 20bn/- takeover bid. The club leadership has agreed to meet him and discuss the matter. Dewji, alias Mo , wanted to own 51 per cent of the club shares, which would make him majority shareholder, while the remaining 49 per cent of the stakes will be owned by other club members. The changes would make Simba the first club in the country and perhaps in the region to transform from members to corporate club ownership.Dewji in his letter, clearly expressed his intention to take over 51 per cent shares of the club for 20bn/-. Dewji said, if the club approved his offer, a special account would be opened and the 20bn/- would be deposited, in which after five years, it would generate an interest of 3.5bn/-.This interest rate, according to Dewji letter, would represent an increase of 17.5 per cent of the initial seed money. At a press conference held in Dar es Salaam last year, Dewji said he wanted the process fast tracked, suggesting a three months period if possible for the deal to be concluded.However, the president of Mohamed Enterprises Limited (MeTL) expressed fears that some club leaders were against the changes. Simba leadership immediately responded the following day by asking the former main club sponsor to attend the Executive Committee meeting on August 15th this year, to critically discuss the matter.In a topsy-turvy general meeting held at the Police Officers Mess Oysterbay in Dar es Salaam last year, the then President, Evans Aveva, announced that the club would go for changes but insisted that the changes would take time because proper procedures must be followed to attain them.In a meeting held under tight security, the majority members insisted that Dewji be allowed to own 51 per cent shares so that he can bring changes and will help the club gain its glorious past.Outlining his plans to make massive transformation, if he wins his 20bn/- bid to take 51 per cent stake, Dewji said he would also enable all long time members of the club to own a specific amount of shares free of charge and the members will be free to either sell or acquire more stakes at their club.He further said that he was determined to raise the club s budget from the current meagre 1.2bn/- to massive 5.5bn/- each season, which he said; it would transform the club s fortunes both financially and at the competition level.
