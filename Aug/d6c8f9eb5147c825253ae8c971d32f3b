The country is tired of hearing about burnt bomas, chaos and conflicts in Loliondo; we want people to hear about homes being connected to electricity and how the people of Ngorongoro will use the amenity to accelerate development, remarked ole Nasha, who is also the Member of Parliament for Ngorongoro.Arusha region with 1.8 million residents is made up of seven districts, including Ngorongoro, Longido, Monduli, Karatu, Meru, Arusha-Urban and Arusha-Rural.
