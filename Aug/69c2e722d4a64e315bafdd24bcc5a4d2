Discussing a paper presented here yesterday by former Vice-Chancellor of the University of South Africa, Professor Barney Pityana, on Good Governance and Rule of Law, Dr Kikwete called upon political parties in Africa to co-exist amicably.According to him, political parties in power should not view opposition parties in the same countries as opponents, but rather as partners in fostering democratic principles based on the rule of law.Dr Kikwete who has in recent days played a key role in restoring peace in Libya, reminded delegates attending the African Leadership Forum 2017 that most political parties in Africa were still growing.Citing the example of his home country Tanzania, Dr Kikwete said the multiparty system was restored in 1992 and are currently still building themselves for the people to understand their policies.He called upon Members of Parliament (MPs) from the ruling party to take to task the government when the ministries are not functioning as per the election manifesto of their political party.

The issue of peace and security is an important topic on our continent because of the challenges that we continue to face. Obviously, they are with us.They are visible, every day he said. The veteran politician also told delegates at the conference that the need to address insecurity in African countries can never be overemphasised because many of us will sense that some of our countries where there is no conflict yet it may break out some point. Mbeki expressed confidence that participants at the meeting have come out with positive ideas and also proffer solutions to the numerous challenges in the continent, not to just address and describe these challenges.
