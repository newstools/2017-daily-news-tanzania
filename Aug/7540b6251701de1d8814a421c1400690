The warehouse constructed under Geita Gold Mine (GGM) support near Saragulwa Village will enable rice farmers store their harvests and sell them when supply is low to fetch better prices.The mining company said in a statement that it has invested 330m/- as construction cost of the warehouse, which lies about 15km from the Geita mine site. A tractor has also been acquired for use at the facility. We appreciate support from GGM in building this warehouse, said Mr Yuda Ng hindi, Chairman of the Saragulwa village and member of the NYABUSAKAMA cooperative Society. We are now very sure to have good space for storing our produce. In keeping with Geita Gold Mine s commitment to procure goods and services locally, Tanzanian-owned Exact line Engineering Company, was awarded the construction contract for the warehouse, whereby over 30 casual labourers were recruited for the work from within the surrounding villages of Nugwe and Saragulwa.The warehouse is completed at 95 per cent awaiting fixing of minor items and is scheduled to be handed over in two weeks time. It s all systems go, said Mr Athuman Chande, chief executive officer of Geita-based Exact Line Engineering. We are on track to complete this work on schedule. Consistent with its core value of leaving host communities with sustainable future that outlast mining activity, GGML has a comprehensive programme of direct investment in the local Geita community through a series of projects including water supply, education and economic development activities in the agriculture, construction and service sectors.Since starting production almost two decades ago, GGML has been a source of significant benefit to all stakeholders, yielding more than 2.3tri/- (US$1.1 billion) in monetary benefit to the Tanzanian government from taxes collected and paid.Significant sums have also been paid over that time to suppliers, contractors, and employees involved in the ongoing operations at the mine.
