The changes became effective on July this year.The Chairman of Kisutu s chicken unit, Mr Mohamed Ndete, said the rise in price has been caused by breeders who have increased farm gate prices to cover for raising expenses which include poultry feed prices.He said the prices have also gone up after market authorities raised stall rental fee for 400 per cent from 300/- per day charged last year to 1,500/- per day. On top of that cooking gas price has gone up from 85,000/- for a 36 kilogramme cylinder to 105,000/-. This is an increase of 20,000/- direct cost to our business we are using gas to boil water for plucking feathers, Mr Ndete said. He said currently their business does not pay them well and are struggling to survive.The Kisutu Market Secretary, Mr Suitbert Nyawalle, said they also are facing competition challenges since there a thousand and one vendors at the market vicinity. We are facing a challenge of few customers and many vendors in the market place, Mr Nyawalle said.Nerbet Mazungwe, a chicken monger at Mtambani Market said they received around 2000 birds per day and are sold within two days. The prices have gone up but we still have customers. The challenge is we are forced to absorb some costs to maintain the prices so as to retain customers, Mr Mazungwe said.Despite the rising costs and fees chicken mongers are also facing yet another challenge of incurring expenses for repairing their stalls which are at pathetic condition.
