Hopefully, the match will just give a glimpse of what the two giants have reaped in terms of arsenal as the transfer nears its climax.The match to be played at the National stadium Dar es Salaam comes three days before Tanzanian Premier League kicks off later this month, involving 14 other teams in a race for the diadem.Arguably, most of the players who headlined the transfer window in bold colours, are those who starred the last season s kick off. They include the season s best hitman Simon Msuva who has now struck a professional deal in Morocco.Also worth to note generally among the marvels of the last season s league, was the country s success in Cosafa Cup, in which Tanzania defied its underdog tag to win bronze, kicking out of race giants; Angola, Malawi, South Africa and Lesotho.The market of the players who helped Taifa Stars shine in Cosafa soared, and Simba s magic hand snatched most of them. Simba signing made big impact in the entire transfer season to the extent that it even overshadowed their rivals, whose notable recruit, is the former Simba stylist, Ibrahim Ajib.Simba s massive signing of Uganda hitman Emanuel Okwi drew massive coverage and so was Haruna Niyonzima snatched from rivals Yanga. Simba almost conquered the entire Azam defence line by signing goalie Aishi Manula, Shomari Kapombe and Erasto Nyoni and completed their onslaught over Ice-cream makers by hiring their long sniper, John Bocco.From what has been explained here it is obvious that our football is becoming business which value players, though what they produce, therefore, while waiting for teams to deliver would be like to advise players to also work hard individually besides the teamwork basis.We end up by wishing the league all the best in terms of skills and profit and requesting officials to strictly adhere to the football rules and regulations.
