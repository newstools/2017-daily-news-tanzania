Speaking during the official launch of the exhibitions at Nyamngolo grounds in Ilemela District here yesterday, Mr Mongela said in order for the country to attain the industrial economy, people should improve the agricultural sector since it is the backbone of the country s economy.Mr Mongela said that more than 80 per cent of residents in the country are depending on the agricultural sector, especially in farming, fishing and animal keeping.According to him, most of the factories depend on raw materials from agriculture. Mr Mongela, however, commended President John Magufuli for his efforts in implementing the industrialisation policy in the country.He also asked the Ministry of Agriculture to make sure that Mwanza Region is also considered in hosting future exhibitions.The Nane Nane preparation committee Chairman, Mr Beda Chamatata, said this year the number of participants has increased compared to last year. Mr Chamatata said farmers should make sure they produce more crops to be sold in national and international markets.He told them to improve the infrastructure of the ground because their committee uses a lot of capital for the preparation of the exhibitions.One of the exhibitors, Tecno Zonal Manager Gerald Tito said during these exhibitions his company will sell various models of phones, including Tecno T39 at the cost of 25,000/- and Tecno CX at the price of 350,000/-.Tito said the exhibition is good and customers are coming in big numbers.
