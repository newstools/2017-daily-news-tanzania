This is due to the fact that a lot has happened over recent times in making the region s economy better as the country reflects on the good memories of the region s economic status.Director for Taxpayer Service and Education at the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), Mr Richard Kayombo, says the authority is not planning to miss the forum after learning of benefits from the previous forums.Speaking with the Daily News over the phone yesterday, Mr Kayombo said through such regional forums organised by the Tanzania Standard Newspapers Ltd (TSN), the taxman managed to impart tax education to many citizens and get immediate feedback over what bothers them as far as paying tax was concerned.Among other issues which emerged in the two previous forums was over the nuisance involved in motor vehicle road licence fee, which was eventually removed by the government and instead the fee has been incorporated in retail fuel prices. As you may be aware, such issue came up during the forum in Simiyu, and TSN s newspapers extensively covered the subject, he said.The forum in Simiyu region exposed to the TRA how citizens were forced to travel to Shinyanga region seeking driving license and motor vehicle registration cards because the TRA s office in Simiyu could not offer such services.Upon hearing grievances from stakeholders, TRA decided to launch its regional office in July this year, with all services becoming available. We will effectively participate in the tomorrow s Tanga forum so that we can provide tax education and hear grievances from taxpayers, because there is no development without tax, he said.He encouraged business people in Tanga and other areas in the country not to opt for closing their businesses simply because they owe the TRA, but instead they should contact the taxman to see how they can pay the outstanding tax by installments while continuing with their business activities. We are here to ensure we help businesses to do better and make sure the government earns the tax it deserves, he said. He argues that when businesses stop operating, the government s revenues also get affected.He appeals to business people in Tanga region to register their businesses and acquire Taxpayer s Identification Number (TIN), saying failure to do that is the same as dodging to pay tax.The taxman is optimistic that the Tanga-Hoima crude oil pipeline project will serve as a catalyst to increase businesses in the region, thus making the government collect more revenue.The Medical Stores Department (MSD), who are also key stakeholders of the forum, vowed that it will use the workshop to make Tanga residents aware of how they can buy medicines and medical equipments directly from them.MSD s Public Relations Officer, Etty Kusiluka says: We want people to know that when an individual plans to buy medical facilities such as wheel chairs, hospital beds and so on for charity purposes, there is no need for them to buy them at high costs from private dealers, they can come and buy from us at a cheap price, When someone buys from the MSD for charity, she said MSD can offer them transport service to carry the items to the intended area.She therefore said that MSD is encouraging local investors in Tanga to see the opportunity of setting up industries for manufacturing medical equipment using raw materials available within the country. For instance, we are forced to import things like hospital drip water and other items made from cotton and animal skin while we have such raw materials in the country, she said. She explains that the government can save a lot of money used to import medical equipment if those products were manufactured locally.
