Agriculture is the most lucrative economic undertaking in the country today...if you want to amass riches, get into agriculture, Mr Bohay, whose institution scooped the top award on the Non-Governmental Organisation category, told visitors to the trust s booth at Ngongo grounds here.He said PASS has in this year directed special efforts to serve the disadvantaged groups in the society like youth and women. Through the Agribusiness Innovation Centre (AIC), PASS is determined to enhance agro-processing to increase value addition on agricultural products, said Mr Bohay, assuring all agri-entrepreneurs of access to agricultural loans from over 12 financial institutions under PASS guarantee. Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan was among the visitors to whom Mr Bohay attended.
