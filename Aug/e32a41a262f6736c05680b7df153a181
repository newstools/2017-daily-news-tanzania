The Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Eng Edwin Ngonyani, made the pledge in Dar es Salaam yesterday shortly after a meeting he held with staff of Universal Communication Service Access Fund (UCSAF), where he also reminded partner communication operators to improve their services in rural areas. With stable communication services to all citizens, the country will easily attain its development plans and hence achieve its goal to become a middle-income country by 2025 telecommunications is vital to us, stressed the deputy minister.He said he decided to visit UCSAF offices specifically to familiarize himself with their services, saying he had since received claims during his various tours to the rural areas that people were being underserved in some areas, and that they had called for better services in order to be able to communicate with their relatives and carry out online businesses.However, he challenged UCSAF to work closely with the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to improve communication coverage in rural areas. The deputy minister said there were still areas where the operators had installed communication towers but had yet to switch-on and that their gadgets covered only a smaller area than the numbers being presented by the operators.He also directed the fund to make regular follow-ups and work closely with local government authorities to confirm the quality of the communication services in rural areas instead of relying only on operators reports.Giving view on the energy used to operate communication towers, he advised UCSAF to look again on the resources used especially solar energy, and said the energy sometimes caused poor communication. the legal framework that governs energy resources used in operating communication towers need to be reviewed as in some hard to reach areas there are towers but there are poor communication services because of the energy used. During heavy rains or at night, for instance, people complain that the service is very poor we need to improve our communication services. We need to improve this kind of energy used or we shift to electricity, he said.UCSAF Chief Executive Officer Eng Peter Ulanga said his firm works to improve accessibility and communication services with a view to promoting both rural and urban socioeconomic development. Villages are our main area of concern that includes all the wards which are economically underprivileged and hard to reach, he noted.
