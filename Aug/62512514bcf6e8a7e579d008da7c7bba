According to a new report released yesterday by the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), people s deposits in the banks had also decreased, indicating they no longer trust the commercial banks.Presenting the findings in Dar es Salaam yesterday, TPSF Financial Advisor, Michael Kitulizo, said the study findings had revealed that the government move to withdraw its accounts from commercial banks to Treasury Single Account (TSU) led to a number of impacts including a shrinking in deposits in commercial banks.But a senior Lecturer at Mzumbe University, Prof Prosper Ngowi, says the government s move to transfer its deposits to BoT wasn t reason enough for the drop in deposits, but that it might have been caused by the government s move to crack the whip against ghost workers, students and salaries. This should be a waking call to commercial banks if their businesses depend heavily on the government, it s time they reviewed their business strategies, the IDM don said.The study was sanctioned by TPSF with the aim of conducting an independent assessment of the timing, efficiency and effectiveness of the government s measure to withdraw deposits from commercial banks.A detailed evaluation matrix linking all the evaluation questions with the responses from the interviewed representatives was accommodated to achieve the objectives of the assessment. The study was carried in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania s commercial city with almost all commercial banks and big private sector companies having their headquarters and numerous branches in the city, Kitulizo said. In his words, purposive sampling technique was used to reach the desired respondents. The collection of data for the indicators identified in the evaluation matrix required a variety of methods and involved different sources and stakeholders. Data was analysed qualitatively, using both collected data from interviews and from documentary review.On January 25, last year, the government of Tanzania through Treasury Registrar issued a government notice which aimed at instructing all the public entities to transfer their deposits held in different commercial banks to BoT by February 1, 2016.The government explained in the notice that the move was aimed at enhancing government and public effectiveness and efficiency in cash management.Yesterday, TPSF Director of Policy, Teri Gilliad said there was a need for the government to help the banks that were affected by the new changes, adding that people have now opted to keep their money in their houses and other channels.
