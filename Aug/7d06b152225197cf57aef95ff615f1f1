The two traditional archrivals, Yanga, who are Premier League defending champions and Simba, Azam Sport Federation Cup (ASFC) winners, will square up on Wednesday in the Charity Shield match to usher in the 2017/18 topflight league campaign.Once again, as it has occasionally been the case going into this attention puller fixture, both Simba and Yanga have crossed the Indian Ocean to the spicy Islands of Zanzibar, as they sought to avoid the destructions of their noisy home city of Dar es Salaam.While Simba have set up camp in Unguja, their rivals are in Pemba, fine tuning for the game, which is crucial for either side as they seek to make a perfect start to this season s league. Yanga were the first to shift their camp from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar.They made a brief stay in Unguja, where they enjoyed a 2-1 against Mlandege in strength-testing match, before proceeding to their favoured Pemba hideout .Simba would soon follow suit. The 23-man Reds squad landed in Unguja early last week and have since been training at Amaan Stadium under their Cameroonian head coach Joseph Omog and his right-hand man, Ugandan Jackson Mayanja, in readiness for the fixture.The Msimbazi Reds also played a strength-testing against Mlandege and were held to a frustrating barren draw at Amaan Stadium on Thursday night, living coach Omog livid. Omog and his right-hand man Jackson Mayanja could not hide their displeasure at their side s lack of cutting edge as Simba failed to break down a resolute Mlandege.In the absence of injured John Bocco and Emmanuel Okwi, who was not included in the playing squad due to what Mayanja said was a technical reason , Burundian Laudit Mavugo, deployed as lone striker failed to make an impact.The Burundian started promisingly and headed against the crossbar but then he was well marshalled by Mlandege s defence. He was replaced by Juma Luizio in the second half.And Omog who spent most part of the game hogging the touchline, could not hold off his anger as occasionally shouted at his lead striker, Mavugo, telling him to be more vibrant inside the box.Heading into the match, the Cameroonian tactician is likely to be without Ghanaian striker Nicholas Gyan, who has yet to rejoin his team. Gyan has only made one appearance for Simba in pre-season since joining from Ebusua Dwarfs in the summer and even if he join the rest in the squad, it leaves him short on his fitness levels that coach Omog will have to weigh up whether to risk him in this Wednesday s annual curtain-raiser.Having coming as a second half substitute at the 1-0 win over Rayon Sport of Rwanda on Simba Day (August 8) at the same venue, Gyan showed some flashes of what he can offer at the Msimbazi Club.On the other side, Yanga camp has been beefed up with the arrival of midfielder, Papy Kabamba Tshishimbi from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and was in great shape ahead of the gigantic tie.The 27- year-old joins Yanga from Swaziland s side Mbabane Swallows. He impressed the Jangwani Street giants after putting up a stunning performance during the CAF Confederation Cup clash between Mbabane Swallows and Azam FC at the Chamazi Complex early this year.After signing a two-year deal, he becomes the sixth foreign player in George Lwandamina s squad out of seven required by the regulations governing the premier league.While the build-up to the game may have only been spiced up with two stunning transfers involving their prodigy sons, Ibrahim Ajib and Haruna Niyonzima, who moved either side, mind games from each camp are just adding to the prevailing excitement.Going into the match on Wednesday, Police in Dar es Salaam have assured players and fans of tight security before, during and after the encounter.
