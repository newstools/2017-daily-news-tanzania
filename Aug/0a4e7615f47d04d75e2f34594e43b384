 There are areas our institution will handle straight away in this region. However, in some areas I will have to consult my government to identify areas for support. We in Korea have specialised in irrigation farming and other modern farming technologies, he said.Songwe Regional Commissioner retired Lt. Chiku Galawa said that the Korean Ambassador in Tanzania, Mr Song Geum-young had visited the region several times. The ambassador, she said, was impressed with the people, whom he praised for working hard and by seriousness of government officials. Songwe has fertile land which is good for all types of agricultural activities and people here work very hard.There is a coal mine and various minerals including diamond, gold, copper and other unique gemstones and would be happy if Korean government works with us in supporting people s development, especially by developing the agricultural sector, she said. Lt. Galawa said because coal is available, the region had banned the use of charcoal for cooking in future.Instead, she said, people will have to use coal. We have decided to ban use of charcoal to protect our environment we will make some small bricks out of coal dust so that we can have alternative cooking energy. People are hard working and youths are ready to embrace positive changes, she said.Agricultural Seed Agency Executive Director Dr Firmin Mizambwa has meanwhile affirmed that the promised Korean support would offer opportunity for Songwe farmers to make big strides and go modern. The ASA chief executive pledged to work closely with KRC in helping villagers because our objective is one. Following the signing of the agreement, he said, farmers should expect quality seeds from his agency. KRC last week signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (Sagcot) to support new irrigation schemes to rural farmers.
