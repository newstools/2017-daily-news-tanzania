he city council despite registering deficit declining from 2.28bn/- in 2015 to 1.95bn/- in 2016, also received a clean financial bill. According to Dar City finance statement issued yesterday, the deficit still lingered as revenues are far below expenses.The statement showed that the city total revenue stands at 9.57bn/- while expenditure totalled 11.53bn/-.The revenues are still far below as taxes and levies went up slightly to 2.9bn/- from 2.72bn/-. On the other hand, revenue grant slightly dropped to 2.58bn/- from 2.68bn/-.While fines, penalties and licence portfolio generated 2.76bn/- up from 2.46bn/- indicating that the city survives on fine and penalties. To boost revenue collection the Dar City introduced geographic information system (GIS). The system was expected to collect 60bn/- per year.The GIS system is a system of geographic information used throughout the world in supporting the sustainable growth of all cities and its activities.The use of GIS system would help to improve revenue collection, transparency in the collection of revenue, controlling leakages of the revenue and to simplify the collection of revenue.The GIS system would enable everyone to see and to get information on revenue collection compared to the past system, which used electronic receipts after payment.
