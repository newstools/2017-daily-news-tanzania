Located 3 kilometres west of the city, the speedily upcoming modern and domestic airport in northeastern Tanzania serves the city of Tanga and its surrounding environs with reliable scheduled flights to Arusha, Dar es Salaam and the Zanzibar Archipelago islands of Unguja and Pemba.Recently, the airport became the talk of the country and attracted once more the attention of the government and the regional administration who thought of several plans to revive it as well as the economy of the region.It is projected that the region will be economically vibrant for it consists of a number of economic activities that will lead to increased number of people from other regions vising the area. No doubt, many of these as well as foreigners will be stimulated to have a glimpse of the economic opportunities including industries, trade and, of course, the Hoima-Tanga crude oil pipeline.That means, initiatives are being taken by the government to develop the economy for Tanga region, including launching new factories. The Hoima-Tanga crude oil project has been tipped as a catalyst for more visitors entering the region, and the airport would play a crucial role as a gateway to the world.According to the Tanga Regional Commissioner Martine Shigela the Hoima-Tanga oil pipeline project has facilitated the fast tracking of the expansion of the airport in order to meet the air transport demand during the implementation of the project.Mr Shigela explains that in the next few years, the region is expected to receive many visitors who would require improved air transport to Tanga. Due to this demand, we should expand our airport from the current size of 1.6 kilometres to at least 2.5 kilometres, he says, adding that already the Director General of the Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA) has visited the port to see the current condition of the airport. We are happy that he has put strategy to ensure that they obtain funds in order to kick start the construction of the airport, he further said. While waiting for the construction work to start, Mr Shigela notes that the immediate measures will be taken to ensure that the flights land anytime as opposed to the current situation where they only land during the day due to lack of lights at night.The construction of this port, however, had been in the government s plans alongside other airports in the country in a move aimed at improving the airports and thus boosting the air transport sector.Last year, the TAA hinted that about 3.9 trillion/- (1.8 billion US dollar) was required to upgrade eight airports. The TAA explained that some projects were already in progress including upgrading of all of them, depending on the availability of money from the government, foreign donors and the authority itself.Along that line, it was estimated that upgrading of the Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) would cost 2.2 trillion/- (1 billion US dollar) and would be done in three phases. Equally, Kigoma and Mtwara airports would be upgraded at a cost of 795.5 billion/- (36.3 million US dollar) and 107.5 billion/- (4.9 million US dollar) respectively.The TAA further stated that 172 billion/- (78.5 million US dollar) would be spent on upgrading the Mwanza airport while Arusha, Tanga and Manyara airports would be upgraded at a cost of 107 billion/- (49 million US dollar) each, while the Dodoma airport construction cost stood at 354.7 billion/- (16.2 million US dollar).
