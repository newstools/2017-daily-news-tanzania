School Headmaster, Thomas Nassary said here that the fire started, or at least was detected at about 8.00 am on Friday and it reduced to ashes nine rooms, housed under a single large dormitory, a storage room and 6 toilets as well as five bathrooms.The doomed dormitory was for girls and it used to house 37 students, among them 18 sophomores, 6 Form One freshers and 9 girls undertaking the Vocational Education Training Authority programs. The school also has a special technical stream.As the result, nearly 20 double-decker beds for the students were razed down. Head of the dormitory, a student known as Grace Mbise was checking the dormitory ready to lock it up to prevent people entering while other were studying in class, when she was surprised to find it filled with smoke.The Police in Arusha Region have confirmed the incident but pointed out that nobody was hurt in the today morning fire eruption at the institution. The school is located at Muungano Village in King ori Ward of Arumeru District.All students happened to be in class when the fire started, which means the dormitory was empty and this helped to avert serious disaster, though at least 20 mattresses, storage lockers and other pieces of bedding were burnt.So far, the school management suspects electric fault to be the cause; From last night (Thursday) all the way to Friday Morning the lights kept flickering and in fact there was prolonged blackout during the night, it is just by sheer luck that the fire did not occur when the girls were asleep, said the Headmaster.It took the combined efforts of local villagers and students to put off the flames that were threatening to engulf the entire school. The fire was finally quenched at around 10.00 am, after two hours of wrestling with the disaster
