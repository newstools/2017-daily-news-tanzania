According to a press statement issued by the Directorate of Presidential Communications, yesterday, the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces issued the order when speaking to high ranking officers of the Police Force at Police Officers Mess in Dar es Salaam.Those who attended the meeting include regional police commanders (RPCs), company commanders from Mainland and Zanzibar and leaders from police headquarters, Minister for Home Affairs Mwigulu Nchemba and Permanent Secretary Major General (ret.) Projest Rwegasira.In his address to the officers, President Magufuli implored the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Simon Sirro, to take firm action to reorganise the Force so as to deal with all drawbacks that have curtailed its performance. You must effect huge changes to the Force. I want to see the real Police Force. You, IGP Sirro, and your commanders must ensure no stone is left unturned until crime is stopped, the President told the IGP.Dr Magufuli added, You must put to an end the killings against innocent civilians; and all incidents of armed robbery and drug abuse. The President warned commanders and all police officers against being used by individuals for personal gains, involvement in corruption, drug abuse, signing bad contracts that end up harming the Force and the nation at large, abuse of office and favouritism in offering employment to candidates and promotion.Dr Magufuli wanted all police officers of all ranks to accord full cooperation to the newly appointed IGP Sirro. The President hailed the police for combating crime, but called for efforts to fight the unfolding incidents of killings of innocent civilians and armed robberies.In their course to fight against crime, the President called upon commanders to conduct fruitful and productive operations in their areas.The meeting between the President and the Police has come against the backdrop of crime in the Coast Region whereby suspected armed bandits have, at different occasions, killed innocent civilians at their homes and police officers on duty.President Magufuli appointed Commissioner Sirro last Sunday as IGP. Before his appointment Commissioner Sirro was serving as Commander of Dar es Salaam Special Police Zone
