The deal will enable Songas to increase gas-fired power generation by 10megawatts (MW). Currently the turbines are generating 180MW equals to 25 per cent of total power generation for nation grid.The MYA encompasses GE s platform of total plant solutions, helping Songas to ensure the long-term, reliable operation of its power plant. The upgrades will help Songas to increase the efficiency and the plant s capacity at the Ubungo plant by approximately 10megawatts (MW), a statement issued by GE read.Songas Managing Director Nigel Whittaker said Songas owns six gas turbines, including 4 GE LM6000 gas turbines which it has been operating at Ubungo Power Plant since 2004. Songas and GE have been working together for several years to ensure high performances of these turbines. Songas is very pleased about this new initiative with GE to help increase the efficiency and reliability of the plant throughout the duration of its agreement, Whittaker said.Under the terms of the deal, GE Fleet 360solution will upgrade three of the four LM6000 gas turbines in the fleet from the LM6000PA to the LM 6000PC, expected to increase the output of the units from 38MW to 43 MW each and reaching output levels of up to 46 MW.The eight-year MYA, which also includes maintenance and repairs of the gas turbines, will help Songas to increase the efficiency of the Ubungo plant to around 41 per cent approximately a 3.0 per cent improvement. As the government of Tanzania continues to pursue the expansion of generation capacity and extend the capability of its power grid, upgrading existing power plants to improve operation and efficiency is a must, said Elisee Sezan, general manager, GE Power Services for Sub-Saharan Africa.According to a World Bank s report, in Tanzania, less than 45 per cent of the nearly 50-million-people are connected to the grid.The government s sector reform plan aims to expand power generation capacity by up to 10,000 MW by 2025, helping to meet increasing energy demands driven by an economy that is expected to continue to grow at a rate of 7.0 per cent annually in 2017 and 2018.
