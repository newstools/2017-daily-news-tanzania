The firm s Business Development Officer, Mr Hassan Sued, said here yesterday that 98 per cent of peasants produce cannot be accounted for so far. We do not know where the rest of the milk goes, he lamented.The Iringa-based ASAS Dairy Milk Company is a local company that has earned international fame and was once described by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa as an indigenous investor others should emulate. Mr Sued pointed out that if 98 per cent of the milk is consumed unexamined, the health of consumers is at risk.He said during dry seasons, milk supplies to the plant is reduced further because animals don t get enough nutritious food, adding that because roads are bad, haulage of milk is problematic. All these challenges have to be addressed cooperatively, he said.
