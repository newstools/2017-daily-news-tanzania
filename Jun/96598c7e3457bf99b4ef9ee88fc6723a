The Minister told the Open Data Ecosystem Partners Workshop in Dar es Salaam on Thursday evening that the government will endorse the policy, which is under the Ministry of Finance and Planning, any time from now. The draft Open Data Policy was modelled on international best practice and suggests that all government data should be open by default unless it infringes on personal privacy or national security, remarked the minister during the workshop.The workshop hosted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) brought together participants from the government, private sector, NonGovernmental Organisations (NGOs) and academicians to discuss contribution made by stakeholders in Open Data.Ms Kairuki, who graced the opening of the workshop, said the government will also like to see private sector and NGOs keep open data in terms of contracts and procurement to maintain transparency. The fifth phase government will foster its governance through transparency and urge all partners to open their data as well, she said.The minister further noted that Open Data system was vital in supporting government s efforts in improving governance and collaboration for more accountability and better services. There is a clear link between our efforts to fight corruption and deliver services and open data, she said. NBS Director General, Dr Albina Chuwa, said the open data initiative started in the country in 2014/15 as part of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Action plan commitment, pointing out that in 2015, NBS organised the first Africa Open Data Conference in the country.She observed that although the Support for Open Government and Open Data Initiative will be winding down over the next six months, the NBS and the government were committed to continue improving quality and accessibility of data in the country. This is not the end of things and we therefore expect to continue working with new stakeholders that are joining the data revolution agenda to support development monitoring, planning and effectiveness in Tanzania, said the NBS Director General.She said the government intends to publish and share key information in form of Open Data about health, education and water sectors. Dr Chuwa noted that for the past two years, NBS has developed the open data portal (opendata.go.tz), from which a large set of data on health, education and water sectors are now easily accessible.
