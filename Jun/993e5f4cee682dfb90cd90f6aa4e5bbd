While the government, on the other hand, benefits by securing potential statistics including births, deaths, marriages, divorces or adoptions, the new under-five birth registration initiative, for instance, has not been useful to the nation.Constitution and Legal Affairs Minister, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, said yesterday that a number of public and private institutions were declining to accept birth certificates - their reasons being the documents are handwritten. These are legal documents and are being issued by authentic authority, he said, wondering why the same still recognise marriage and death documents which are also handwritten.I want the Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (RITA) management to engage all stakeholders including public and private institutions to understand the necessity of the documents.RITA commissioned a pilot project to register under five-year-old children in seven Mainland regions early this year. A number of region succeeded by 100 per cent.However with the emerging trend of sensitive institutions turning against the document this would affect implementation of the same initiative in other areas in the country. This is why you need to strengthen public awareness, the minister said shortly before launching a National Strategy for CRVS in Tanzania Mainland. Official government figures show that 13 per cent of the total population surveyed in 2012 by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) were registered.The National CRVS strategy is a new system which will help increase the number of citizens registered, according to Rita Chairman Prof Hamis Dihenga. Prof Dihenga told a meeting here yesterday that a huge number of Tanzanians are not visible, thus affecting the government s development plans. It s a vital process for both of us. All Tanzanians need to be registered to allow the country to plan well, he said.
