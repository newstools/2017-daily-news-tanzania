Speaker Ndugai ordered Sergeants at arms to take MP Mnyika out of the Parliamentary debating chamber during the morning session after the opposition legislator traded verbal attacks with Mtera MP on CCM ticket Livingstone Lusinde.However, the decision taken by the Speaker to evict Mnyika appeared to anger Members of Parliament of the opposition camp, prompting them to walk out in protest.As opposition MPs walked out in protest against the decision by Speaker Ndugai, Civic United Front ( CUF) MP for Mtwara Urban Constituency Maftaha Nachuma refused to join the bandwagon, instead he remained seated.Despite being asked by the Speaker to follow the procedures to register his concern, Mnyika resorted to exchange bitter words with MP Lusinde, an act that forced Mr Ndugai to evict him.
