The biggest number of tourists came from the UK followed by the US for Tanzania mainland while in Zanzibar Italy comes second after UK in number of tourists.According to Dr Nzuki, many tourists come from those countries due to historical factors and investments. Tanzania was colonised by the UK and many investors from those countries have invested in the country, so they bring in their families and relatives for leisure and holidays in national parks and beaches. On average, each tourist spends 178 US dollars (383,000) per day, and many of them come for leisure and holidays.The tourists, who were asked over the country s tourism sector, replied that more was supposed to be done in improving infrastructure, particularly roads and airports to attract more tourists.Meanwhile, Dr Nzuki said the government was in the process of reviewing the law that restricts people to invest in historical sites, which are now over 500.He noted that the review is aimed at enabling investors to invest in the historical sites in a bid to refurbish them and make the areas attract more tourists and contribute more foreign currency to the country.
