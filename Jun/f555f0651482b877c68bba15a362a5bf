Deputy Minister of State in the Prime Minister s Office responsible for Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled, Mr Anthon Mavunde told Parliament during question and answers session that the government is closely assessing the performance of recruitment agencies in the country.He said recruitment agencies that will be found guilty of violating the recruitment of Tanzanians abroad will have their licences cancelled and other legal measures will be taken against them. The government is serious on that matter, there is a number of Tanzanians who work abroad especially in Arab countries. We are asking recruitment agencies and the public in general to follow all stipulated procedures when seeking employment abroad, he said.He said the government has already given instructions that whoever wishes to work abroad must keep his/her records with TaESA so that there could be a follow up in case there is a problem.Mr Mavunde was responding to Chambani MP (CCM), Mr Ussi Salum Pondeza who wanted to know when the government would ratify the convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers.He said in 2011, International Labour Organization (ILO) mem ber countries including Tanzania endorsed the convention. He said so far 23 countries out of 189 countries have ratified the convention.He said in Africa, only two countries such as South Africa and Mauritius have so far endorsed the convention.
