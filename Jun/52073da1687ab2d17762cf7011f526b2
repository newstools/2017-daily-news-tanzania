A Deputy Minister in the President s Office, (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr Suleiman Jaffo told Parliament yesterday that the government is aware of the increase number of students who join A-level studies and that it determined to build high schools in each division across the country.The deputy minister was responding to Segerea MP (CCM), Ms Bonnah Kaluwa who wanted to know when the government would build high schools in Segerea constituency.She said Segerea constituency has a total of 11 secondary schools but has no single high school. She said students from secondary school in the area have been recording good performance and thus qualify to join A-level studies.Ms Kaluwa said that a total of 400 students passed their Form Four examinations in 2015 and qualified to join A-level studies. However, most of them were forced to seek opportunities away from their home because there is no high school in the area.According to Ms Kaluwa, many of those students fail to get opportunities because there is no nearby high school in the constituency. She asked the government to build high schools in the locality so that students could easily enroll for A-level studies. These students are facing transport challenges. Their parents also incur cost of paying them fare to go to school because there is no high school nearby, she said. Responding to the matter, Mr Jafo said that Ilala Municipal Council has a total of 49 secondary schools.He said out of the 49, only seven enroll students for Form Five and Form Six studies. He said the municipal council is improving infrastructure to upgrade Juhudi Secondary School to accommodate A-level students.Moreover, Mr Jafo added that the municipal council has long-term plans to build a total of six high schools in the area. He said the project is set to take off between 2017 and 2022.
