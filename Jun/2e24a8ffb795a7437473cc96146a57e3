Minister for Information, Culture and Sports Dr Harrison Mwakyembe has insisted that the deadline is looming, warning that journalists who would not have upgraded their professional credentials by 2020, will be shown the door.The Minister issued the Dr Mwakyembe warning and advice when speaking to the Sunday News in an exclusive interview, recently.The Minister s warning is based on the professional requirements stipulated in the Media Services Act of 2016.According to him, it was imperative for all journalists who lacked professional academic requirements to strive to acquire at least a diploma by 2020 or risk being barred from practicing.In February, this year, the government announcedcompletion of the regulations for the law that came into effect in December, last year.It will be recalled that a hot discussion ensued last year as stakeholders debated the then Media Services Bill and presented views on the level of minimum education for journalists in the country.Some stakeholders wanted the law to restrict a bachelor s degree as lowest level of education for those who wanted to practice jour-nalism, while others settled for a diploma course in the profession or in related courses.However, in the end, the law and its regulations settled for a diploma in mass communication, journalism or other related courses as a minimum qualification for a person to work in the sector.During interview Dr Mwakyembe said the report on the assessment of the quality of broad-casting carried out by the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) in 2016/17 financial year, served as an eye-opener to the government and to media practitioners themselves on the need to take measures to bring sanity to the profession.The assessment report was made public by Dr Mwakyembe when tabling his 28.2bn/- budget for the 2017/18 financial year.According to the report, 90 per cent of broadcast journalists in the country did not possess req-uisite qualifications in the media profession.Revealing the report, Dr Mwakyembe was quoted saying: The assessment was conducted in good faith and did not aim at insulting anyone in the media industry --- it revealed the actual situation of the broadcasting pro-fessional background. The Minister reiterated the need for broadcast journalists and other media practitioners to take the matter seriously and rectify the situation for the betterment of the industry in the country.The Minister explained that electronic media was rapidly expanding, calling for the need to improve it through training and further courses to better manage the rapidly growing industry. We are currently experienc-ing a rapid increase of electronic media, contrary to the past where we used to deal with only a few television and radio stations.Today, we have over 148 radio and 32 TV stations.This compels us to improve the industry, he noted.He further disclosed that the Media Services Act of 2016 requires all the media practitioners to have a minimum of diploma in media profession where the government gave five years as a grace period for those who work in the media but do not have that minimum qualification to pursue diploma courses.Dr Mwakyembe affirmed that after the deadline, the government will not hesitate to implement the requirements as the law states. Those who will not have acquired the qualifications as stipulated in the law, within the given period, will have to go as the government will not hesitate to ensure the law is implemented as required, he stressed.Director of Tanzania Information Service Department (Maelezo) Dr Hassan Abbas called upon stakeholders, especially media owners to value the TCRA report by ensuring all journalists in the media industry acquire the minimum qualifications come 2020.According to Dr Abbas, his department will not issue accredi-tation to journalists without the stipulated qualifications after the grace period set elapses.Currently, Maelezo issues accreditation to journalists without considering new professional qual-ifications, as they are being guar-anteed by their employers, insist-ing that such a trend will come to an end after the set deadline.
