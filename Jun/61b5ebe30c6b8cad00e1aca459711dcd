Bishop Mapunda made the appeal at Siuyu village in Ikungi District during the celebrations to mark the 10th Anniversary of the Rehabilitation Centre for Children with Disabilities.He said, children with disabilities were different from other normal children because they require special treatment. Children with disabilities need tender care and high standard of love so that they can feel they are part and parcel of the society, he observed.The cleric further noted that if the said children were treated with utmost love and fully taken care of, they would become independent to a certain extent and therefore alleviate the burden for their parents and guardians.He also urged parents and guardians to make sure that they provided their children with all the basic needs because that is their right. Quoting some verses from the Bible, Bishop Mapunda said children were clean before God. Let little children come to me, do not forbid them for the kingdom of heaven is theirs he said. I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.Whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven . Due to the importance and value of a child, he said, every parent, every guardian and every member of the community had the duty to help the child so that he / she can realize his / her hidden dreams.In a message read by Charles Kitiku on behalf of the Catholic Church Apostolic Servants at the area, the Centre was established in 2007 by Father Tom Ryan of the Pallotine Missionaries. It faces a number of challenges including shortage of day to day operational funds, teachers with special education skills, wheelchairs and non availability of Health Insurance for the children.
