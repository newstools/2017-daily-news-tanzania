The pieces of timber were harvested by traders without acquiring permits and were kept in their warehouses unlawfully.Speaking to journalists here on Friday the TFS Manager in Kahama District, Mr Bruno Bahane, said the traders were arrested last month during a special operation which involved his office and the district security committee.Mr Bahane said that TFS has been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that citizens conserve the forest resources including planting trees. We conducted a onemonth operation in all forests in Kahama District and the warehouses for timber dealers and managed to seize 2,904 pieces of timber, 53 bags of charcoal and 74 logs, he said.He said that in order to fight against people who conduct timber business illegally, they were forced to collaborate with the Committee in breaking into the warehouses and discovered that the products lacked a rubber stamp from his office.He explained that timber or logs which are meant for business must have special permits from TFS and other important documents but the trader were found to have shortfalls by 100 per cent.The manager called upon people to observe the laws when engaging in the business to avoid inconveniences.
