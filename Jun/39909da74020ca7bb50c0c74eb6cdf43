The Vice-President gave the order in Dar es Salaam, yesterday, following reports that acts of child sexual abuse and mistreatment were becoming rampant in certain communities in the country.VP Samia was officially closing a campaign aimed at controlling non-communicable diseases among children and youth. During the campaign a total of 1,500 children and youth underwent medical check-up before being treated.The campaign was carried in conjunction with celebrations to mark the Day of the African Child, an event held at Kinyerezi Primary School grounds in Dar es Salaam.According to VP Samia, such evil-doers had no place in the society, saying communities should expose them to relevant authorities so that legal measures could be taken against them.The Vice-President said it was sad to learn that despite the fact that such evil people were living among communities, people were finding it difficult to report them to the authorities. These evil doers must be exposed by the public in general, parents and guardians because they live among us, she insisted.VP Samia ordered state organs to be alert and take quick action against such individuals. She also implored primary and secondary school students to inform their teachers and police whenever they come across such people or criminal acts.She said that being vigilant against child sexual abusers will provide safe environment for children both at home and school. A child will benefit from equal opportunities in the society only if he/she will be protected and assured of good health, the VP insisted.Speaking on non- communicable diseases, the VicePresident said the problem is serious in Sub-Saharan Africa as the death toll is high. She said there was pressing need to step up efforts to fight the diseases since the government was spending much in treating the affected, including adults, children and youth.

If proper control measures are not taken, the diseases tend to curtail efficiency in work places, reduce productivity and eventually impact on the country s national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), she said.She added that to address the problem, the government will increase and expand centres for providing medical services to people suffering from cancer. She said the government will start implementing the decision by building a new building at Ocean Road Cancer Institute and other new structures at Bugando Referral Hospital.She said the establishment of Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute is among measures taken to deal with non-communicable diseases through which billions of taxpayers money has been saved by attending patients who coul
