For some years now, residents of Mlimba constituency have been requesting the government to build primary courts in their area so that they can stop travelling long distances to seek judicial services.Yesterday, the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, told Parliament that the government through his ministry is planning to build a primary court in Mlimba Division.Prof Kabudi said there is one primary court in Mlimba constituency, but its buildings are in bad shape and thus need renovation. He said the government has allocated fund for the construction of a new primary court in the 2017/18 fiscal year budget and that soon things will change in the area.He said that the government is aware of the chal lenges that Mlimba residents are going through in seeking judicial related services. Prof Kabudi said Kilombero is among the largest districts in the country and that court services have been a big challenge in such districts.He mentioned others as Kiteto and Loliondo. He said there is need for building more primary courts in Kilombero and other big districts to ease services to wananchi . I understand that Kilombero District is among the districts that face challenges, they need more primary courts, he said.The Minister informed MPs that the government is working hard to ensure that there are enough primary courts and magistrates in all districts across the country. Prof Kabudi was responding to Mlimba MP (Chadema), Ms Suzan Kiwanga who wanted to know when the government will build a new primary court in her constituency.She said the current primary court in the area was in bad shape and that there were no enough court magistrates to serve wananchi.
