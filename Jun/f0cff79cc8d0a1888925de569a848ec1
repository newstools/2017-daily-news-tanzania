The Foundation, headed by Mr Andrew Goodall has chipped in to support the government so that from the young age, children learn well how to manage resources.Mr Goodall, a famous British businessman, says his partners, workers of the foundation and himself resolved to invest in education in Tanzania for their love for the country.Tanzania has a lot of resources and should target to be leading economically in Africa and that could only be achieved through provision of quality education from low levels, according to Mr Goodall.The organisation supports individuals on their journey to becoming independent in order to live a flourishing and fulfilled life. We work in partnership with others to enable children, young people and their communities to stand on their own two feet with confidence and to find success, purpose and happiness in learning, work and life. We seek to establish new models of charitable work that marry business with social good applying latest business concepts and methodologies in order to break the cycle of dependence between beneficiaries and benefactors.These models include corporate partnerships, social investment as well as grant seed-funding and consultancy, he says. Mr Goodall says theirs is a new charity; they have in place a team with decades of experience in non-profit, education, business and entrepreneurship.It is such skills that he says should and are being imparted in Tanzanians, as it is learned people who could manage resources well. Having visited Arusha and Ngorongoro, Mr Goodall does not hide his sadness when he recalls how pupils have been learning while seated on the floor instead of using desks.He seems also not contented with amount and quality of food supplied. Another challenge that has been singled out by many individuals and institutions after researches is long distances between pupils; homes and schools they attend.This has a lot of ramifications, from lack of concentration in class, poor pass marks to early pregnancies and dropouts in schools. For the two districts, particularly, the foundation has embarked on setting good environment for quality education that would be beneficial to the teachers, pupils and the schools.The project entails, among other things, training to teachers on leadership skills and how better to deal with pupils and make them understand better what they are taught and how the same should be applied in managing country s resources.In the current session 25 head teachers got the training. The chairman says that what is done in Tanzania has been as well extended to India We adopt a rounded view of who individuals are, how they live and what they need.We have developed a holistic impact model that allows us to have a multifaceted yet focused structure to our work. There are three interconnected areas; Education - formal learning at school and elsewhere) Strengths &amp; Skills personal development and life skills and Enterprise &amp; Innovation new, sustainable models of charitable activity. We particularly look to support projects whose impact goes across two or three of these areas, he says. Mr Gabriel Daqarro, Arusha District Commissioner thanked Mr Goodall for deciding to use his own funds to improve education in Arusha and Ngorongoro districts. He promised that the government would cooperate with the Foundation so that more teachers get leadership training, renovate school buildings and construct modern laboratories to ensure quality education is provided.Ngorongoro District Education Officer, Ms Anyamisye Mahali says the training would highly change the way of teaching and pupils would benefit a lot. His district s education office would strive to ensure that Ngorongoro gets number on slot in quality of education provided within the region and Tanzania generally.The Director of Education with the Goodal Foundation, Lynn Thackway says it all started back in January 2016 when they held a conference for over 100 delegates including 62 head teachers in Ngorongoro district. The area has a large Maasai population and the schools are remote, difficult to access with children often walking one to two hours to get to school with no food to sustain them through the day; quite a grim picture.What we encountered at that conference was a group of head teachers who were passionate about changing their schools and thirsty for advice, guidance and leadership training. What followed this experience and based on their feedback was a two-day conference in June 2016 at Karatu for a group of 64 head teachers and their deputies from Ngorongoro and Longido districts facilitated by the University of Brighton. It became evident that the head teachers needed leadership training in order to mentor their colleagues, says Ms Thackway.After researching what happens in the UK and what was available in Africa, she says, The Goodall Foundation decided to support transformation of primary education through a new Educators Leadership and Management Programme.
