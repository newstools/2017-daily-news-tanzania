Confirming the estab-lishment of the ambitious project, GRA ActingExecutive Director and Board Member Mr Madaraka Nyerere said here yesterday that the machines will be the first of its kind to be intro-duced in the country.Mr Madaraka said prepa-rations are in top gear and that already his organisation has appointed five members for basic training on the new technology targeting to contribute in environmental conservation. We are here to walk the talk as far as the environmen-tal conservation campaign is concerned.And we are using this year s commemorations to demonstrate the machine, he said.This year s Environmen-tal Day is marked in Butiama, the home of the founder of the nation Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere, who among other things was highly devoted in keeping the environment friendly for present and future genera-tions.However, according to the Solar Fire Concentration Field OperationsOfficer Mr Heikki Lind-fors, the available machines for the time being are those suitable for entrepreneur groups and not for individual users. While developing this technology, we have kept in mind the African landscape with the technology that is easy to apply with locally available materials and un-complicated maintenance, he said.The project dubbed GoSol Project has models capable of generating up to 6KW, and its application can vary from roasting 20kg of peanuts in around 3 hours or bake 100 scones in 35 minutes or bake 30 loaves of bread in 40 minutes.Commenting on the anticipated project, GRA member Ms Monica Macha from Alpha Women Group of Musoma said the coming of the new solar powered technology is good news for the group.However, she said the available machines which have been introduced are very expensive for them to afford, with each being sold at between 2000 to 2500 Us Dollars (around 5.5m/-).
