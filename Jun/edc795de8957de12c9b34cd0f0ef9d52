The remarks were made by Tigo s Northern Zone Director, Mr George Lugata yesterday at the Kareem Orphanage Centre in Arusha after he offered different items to needy children.He said that orphans have been isolated and quite often they fall into mental and psychological disorder - a situation that has as well affected their studies. He added that once they are given gifts by different people they feel delighted, a situation that may boost their education performance. Today we have come to this centre to play with and talk to these children, he said. Meanwhile, the Director for Kareem Orphanage centre, Ayubu Mohamed, appreciated the visit and revealed how it had brought happiness to the centre.He asked other stakeholders to support the orphanage in a bid to help get rid of some difficulties in running the establishment.
