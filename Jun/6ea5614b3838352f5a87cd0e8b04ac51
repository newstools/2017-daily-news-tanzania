We have lately been in discussion with Niyonzima on the renewal of his contract, but we have failed to reach into an agreement and so we have decided to leave him and let him decide on his own future.The club wishes him all the best in his life, said Mkwasa. Niyonzima joined Yanga in July 2011 from Rwanda s APR and has always been a pillar for the club in its local and international campaigns.He has won four Premier League titles with the club, two Kagame Cup titles and two Charity Shields. Niyonzima has also played crucial role in helping the club to reach the last eight of CAF Confederation Cup in 2016.The ball is on Simba s court now to finish it all, and the Msimbazi Reds VicePresident, Geoffrey Nyange alias Kaburu hinted yesterday that the deal to sign Niyonzima is almost done.Yanga and Simba were on neck to neck battling for the signature of the virtuoso midfielder with his price tag reportedly reaching 120m/- For the past week or so, the player has been on the headlines regarding his destination next season with Simba being tipped as the more likely side to lure the star.And, unconfirmed report had it that the player had already entered into pre contract agreement with the Msimbazi Reds.
