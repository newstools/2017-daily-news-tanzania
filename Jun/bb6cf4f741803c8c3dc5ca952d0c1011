Teachers mostly perform their responsibility of teaching the young learners, and parents or guardians on their part ought to monitor the progress of their children and assist them in their homework.When a pupil has performed poor in his/her national final examination, always teachers are to be blamed, and the parents are the first to point accusing fingers that such teachers are not performing their duties by following up academic progress of their children.But in actual sense, parents and school management should cooperate through frequent school meetings to address such matters before they go out of hand. This is the opportunity to discuss challenges, and monitor progress of the children, instead of portioning blames yet all parties are tasked play role in academic upbringing of a child.Poor attendance of parents and guardians in meetings at times has been noted to contribute to poor meeting taking place with school management to discuss children s academic excellence.Like in this period of free education programme, some parents have misunderstood the concept and think that everything has been taken over by the government in upbringing their children, something that is not the case.Some even revisited the November 27, 2015 local government Circular 5, that implemented the Education and Training Policy of 2014, and directed public institutions to ensure that primary and secondary education is free for all children.This included the removal of all forms of fees and contributions. According to the policy, provision of free education means pupils or students will not pay any fee or other contributions that were being paid by parents or guardians before the release of the new circular.According to Mapinduzi Primary School Deputy Head teacher, Richard Chilongani, in his institution at Kigogo area in Kinondoni District, he cites truancy in his school as a factor that has been discussed in such meetings and still leading to poor academic performance in standard Four and Seven national examinations.He blames the chronic absenteeism to non-cooperation between parents or guardians with his institution, adding that many parents hardly make a follow up of their children s academic progress including checking up their exercise books and assisting them in doing homework. We have been recording impressive results at our school for the past three years save for last year, and this is due to absenteeism of some pupils. Many parents are now reluctant to attend meetings after the government announced the free education policy, he explained and reminded parents and guardians to play their roles rather than leaving all responsibilities to teachers.However, Gilman Rutihinda Primary School Deputy Head teacher, Vitus Mhonzwa in the same area, had a different opinion in the corporations.He said his school has not only managed to maintain its academic excellence due to the committed hard work of his staff, but it has been the cordial relationships between parents as well as guardians and the school management.According to the teacher, cordial cooperation between parents and teachers is the great secret of their achievement as well as good disciplined.He said parents of pupils who are studying at the school are ready to cooperate with teachers in many ways including providing donations agreed in meetings to ensure their pupils are doing well in their examinations.He said poor communication between teachers and parents normally influence poor free education programme and affect the environed outcome.He said with good corporation, programmes such as providing food to the children at schools are possible because the same parents may decide to donate money and purchase food in schools unlike the previous days before the policy.Though food programme in schools has been automatically cancelled and pupils are now responsible to purchase their own meals, it should be noted that not all children are provided with money to buy food while in school and that perhaps leads to some of them becoming truants.Parents and school management ought to discuss and agree on how to provide food to their pupils in schools in order to improve the academic performance.The mistake some parents seem to be making thinking that a free education programme means everything has been handed over to the government should be revisited by the same parents.It is true that parents are so busy trying to eke out a living including other life responsibilities for their children, but it is better for them also to allocate some time to make a follow up of their kids academic performance in schools.They should maintain good relationship with school managements by attending such meetings frequently. Parents ought to remember that teachers plenty of hours to stay with the children in schools compared to at home, hence they require a lot of support in order to help the kids.
