Former President, Mr Jakaya Kikwete, pointed this out in a speech read on his behalf by the former Prime Minister, Mr Mizengo Pinda, during the launch of REPOA book titled Research and Policy Nexus: Perspective from twenty years of Policy Research in Tanzania in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. In any dynamic world, the context and landscape governing the economic and social progress changes over time, demanding new policy actions to respond to complex relationships between factors that affect the socio-economic life, said Mr Kikwete.He went on to reveal that for policy actions to respond effectively and adequately to changes, research must provide evidence to inform their design and also to assess their impact so that policy adjust ments are put in place.Mr Kikwete noted that the book launched today (yesterday) continues to remind us that the fight against poverty is far from over and that research is one of the important weapons in support of this fight. It also tells us that the most sustained way of fighting poverty is accelerating our economic growth while promoting inclusion. The former President extended recognition to REPOA for playing a very critical role in research and analytical work which provided very significant input to the government over the years in arriving to the set national targets I am sure that they (REPOA) will continue to undertake this quality and relevant policy research to continue to inform our revolving development agenda not only in the country, but also across the continent to implement the 2063 African Union (AU) agenda, he said.The Executive Director of Policy Research for Develop ment (REPOA), Dr Donald Mmari noted that policies, research evidence and policy dialogue remains very critical in arriving at Tanzania s development vision 2025 and its operational plans. This book is a reflection of our work over the past 20 years, however, it points to the future of Think Tanks and the country. More work will be needed to address new challenges that emerge in this ever-dynamic world, noted Dr Mmari.A renowned academician, Prof Issa Shivji, observed that any good research is bound to be critical, of long-term horizon and aims to seek knowledge and truth to yield intended results. Our researches as intellectuals should not only base on policy makers, doing so will affect our sustenance if not used, noted Prof Shivji.
