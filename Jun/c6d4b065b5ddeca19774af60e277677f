According to the Deputy Minister for Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Eng Stella Manyanya, the construction is set to take off at the end of this month. We allocated the fund in the 2016/17 budget, all preparations are ready and the project is set to take off at the end of this month, she said.She said the government is finalising processes of signing contracts with Tanzania Building Agency (TBA) and that soon the construction will begin. Eng Manyanya was responding to Makete MP (CCM), Prof Norman Sigala, who wanted to know when the government will build dormitories for VETA in Makete District.He said currently VETA was offering studies for students from nearby areas instead of offering opportunities to students from Matamba, Kuwo, Magoma, Bulongwa and Ukwama divisions.He added that students from Lupilo and Tandala wards cannot benefit from the training offered at VETA due to lack of dormitories. Eng Manyanya said the government is committed to building dormitories and other infrastructure in various schools, colleges and VETA centres across the country to boost education and promote vocational training.The Vocational Education and Training Authortion and Training Authortion and Training Author ity (VETA) was established by an Act of Parliament No. 1 of 1994 charged with broad tasks of coordinating, regulating, financing, promoting and providing vocational education and training in Tanzania.The history of VETA dates back to 1940 when the Apprenticeship Ordinance was enacted to guide training in the industry. The Vocational Training Act of 1974, which established the National Vocational Training Division, was replaced by the Vocational Education and Training Act of 1994.VETA was basically established to ensure provision of quality vocational education and training that meets labour market needs, through effective regulation, coordination, financing, and promotion, in collaboration with stakeholders .
