 I received a directive of co-ordinating the MP s arrest from the Zonal Crime Officer on June 28, last year for distributing seditious statements at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court s premises in Dar es Salaam, claimed Mgonja.Before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate, Godfrey Mwambapa, OCCID Mgonja, who is the fourth witness in the case, also said he arrested Lissu on June 29, last year at 1 pm at his residence in Tegeta in Kinondoni District and handed him over to the ZCO s offices. The order granted by the ZCO alone was enough to implement the arrest without a warrant, for in any criminal offence this can be carried out without it, he said.According to the charges, Lissu is alleged to have committed the offence on June 28, this year, at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court in Ilala District in the city, when he uttered the claimed seditious words.The magistrate adjourned the case to July 10, this year, when the court will push through with the hearing. The bail for the accused is still in force.
