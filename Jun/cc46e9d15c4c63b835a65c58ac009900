Things are no longer the same on the beautiful, historic Islands. While civilisation and uprightness remain intact for a larger population, crime incidents and drug abuse among the youth are on the rise and are a worrying aspect among noble islanders.The locals are dismayed by this shift of paradigm. Thus they would not shy away from warning a visitor to be watchful of a few felons and naughty guys whose population is soaring day by day in the growing cities of Zanzibar.Increased cultural interference with non-islanders is one of obvious reasons for the moral decay experienced in Zanzibar currently, but the rise in teenage drug use is to blame for the spiraling of criminalities.Drug barons have turned the beautiful sand beaches of Zanzibar into a hub of the global drugs trade, exploiting the island's strategic position off the East Coast of Africa as a stop-off connecting producers in North America and Far East with consumers in the developed world.In recent years, Zanzibar has increasingly been used as a warehousing site and transit route for illicit drugs and precursor chemicals. And the greed for easy money tempts youth to engage in the drug trade.The growth in illegal hard drugs trade in Zanzibar is said to have escalated after a recent crackdown in Mainland Tanzania - which drug cartels used as the main dispersal points for illicit drugs.The all-out war on drug dealers pushed them to the Isles. The consequence of drug abuse among the youth is detrimental due to the rising of drugrelated harms in Zanzibar such as crimes, violence, corruption, HIV Aids and fatal overdose.The government and families are losing a dependable workforce. Currently, there are over 20 sober houses across Zanzibar and that gives a clue about the magnitude of the problem and a need for a comprehensive approach to combat the threats posed by drug trafficking and related-harms.Drug abuse is a huge concern for the government and civil societies. Given Zanzibar's tinny size and small population, rising drug among the young generation poses a big threat to the well-being of this Island with around 1 million people.The government of Zanzibar is concerned with rising drug abuse among its people and is determined to make Zanzibar unfavourable, a high-risk and a low value territory for drug barons.Second-Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, speaking during the launch of Tanzania Green Crescent Community (TGCC) here last week, reiterated the government's commitment to fighting the drug menaces in the island and make Zanzibar unfavourable, a high-risk and a low value territory for drug dealers.Amb. Iddi said in its quest to make the country drug free, the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar is fighting on all fronts to deter producers, sellers and users of the illicit drugs.Amb. Iddi warned that no culprit will be spared in the war against drug peddling and abuse, saying perpetuators of hard drugs business will be searched upon, apprehended and taken to court to face arm of the law."Like many other countries that have been affected by drug abuse, Zanzibar is experiencing a rising number of drug addicts, we're all witness how our youth are being affected by drugs. These young addicts are the nation's labour force and the dependable workforce of their families," the vice-president said in a statement read on his behalf by the Minister for Work, Employment, Empowerment, Elders, Youth, Women and Children, Mr Moudline Castico.Despite government's resolve to fighting drugs, the existence of an ill-equipped AntiNarcotics Police Unit makes the war against strong drug cartels a difficult mission. The law enforcing agent concedes that controlling the flow of illegal drugs from abroad is proving to be a herculean task for the unit.A report on the status of drug abuse and trade in Zanzibar ranging from January 2016 to May, 2017 issued by the Anti-Narcotic Unit in the force recently paints a gloomy of the Island's drug war.The report highlights a range of obstacles hindering the war against drug trafficking and abuse, which range from poor working environment, lack of modern working instruments and incompetence to ineffective laws, porous borders, corruption and public irresponsiveness.Despite being tasked with one of the trickiest and dangerous task, the Anti-Narcotic Unit raises concern that they are using a small building which does not adequately meet their requirements as far as their responsibilities are concerned."The building has a dire shortage of furniture and the stores used for storing exhibits are not safe, which could result to the loss of those exhibits. There is no custody suite for drug suspects, so they kept in other police stations," reads the report.Inadequate or lack of working instruments such as computers, cars for patrols, detection dogs and drug detection machines are other main challenges faced by Anti-Narcotic Unit."Our police officers in checkpoints use outdated meth ods to detect drugs simply the Unit often faces a shortage of modern equipment," says the report, adding that the Isles Anti-Narcotic Police have not been trained at all to patrol the streets and carry out law enforcement operations.On the other hand, deficiencies in hard drug laws are used as loopholes by corrupt and unpatriotic judges to dismiss drug cases and let drug suspects free, allowing them perpetuate the drug trade, claims the report.Out of 363 drug cases, only 104 were filed in courts between January and December last, of which only seven suspects were convicted, 12 were acquitted and 44 were released by police.Investigation into 196 cases is yet to be completed, with some suspects who were bailed out pending investigation said to disappear alongside their guarantors.From January to May this year, a total number of 250 drug cases have been filed, of which only 19 cases have been filed into the court. Two suspects were convicted while investigation for 221 is still going on.Eight suspects have been released by police. The Anti-Narcotic Unit's efforts in combatting drug trafficking at Airport and Zanzibar Port proves futile, given that there are about 500 unofficial ports across the Indian Ocean Islands which enable drug cartels operate their business easily.The report calls for increased number of law enforcement authorities, improving their capacity and use of modern and innovative technology to fighting drug abuse, smuggling and uncovering the market for illegal substances.
