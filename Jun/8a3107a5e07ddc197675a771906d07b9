Announcing the ultimatum in Dar es Salaam,the Kinondoni Municipal Mayor, Mr Boniface Jacob, said the adverts of any company that would defy the ultimatum would be withdrawn, its proprietors would face legal actions.He remarked further: These companies cheated us by giving wrong specifications of the sizes of advertising billboards, and consequently denied us of revenue that we would have channeled into various development projects. The mayor explained that the municipality had been collecting 2.5bn/- instead of 13bn/- that small and large adverts displayed in various areas would have generated.He said 12 big advertising companies and 33 small ones will have to pay taxes that match specific sizes in terms of length and width, citing prominent indebted companies as A1 Outdoor, Continental Media, Masoko Agency, Tan Outdoor, Alliance Media, Brokcline Media, Spark Ooh, Global System, Syscope Media, Label Promotion, Ashton Media, and Platnum Media.Others are Freedom Communication, Telegraph Media, Golf Premix, Eurocom Media, 2M Media, FCW, Loft Media, Sayona, Camel, Startimes, Libert Media, DSTV, FINCA, Kisenga Laph, Kalax Promotion, FEJOS, Colesioum Hotel and Nabaki Africa.
