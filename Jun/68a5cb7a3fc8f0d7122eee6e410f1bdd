Presenting the state of the economy in Parliament yesterday, Dr Mpango said the growth per capita in US dollar terms increased at a slow pace to reach 979.1 dollars last year from 967.5 dollars in 2015 suggesting the country needs to boost productivity, value and volume of exports and reduce imports.According to the World Bank, the Middle Income Countries (MICs) are defined as having a per capita gross national income of 1,026 dollars to $12,475 dollars.The slow pace of growth in the per capita implied that more concerted efforts have to be taken for the desired middle income status target to be attained, he said. As such efforts to increase per capita income in dollar terms need to be stepped up to entail increased productivity, value and volume of exports while improving access of basic essential goods from domestic markets in views of reducing the amount of imports, he said.In local currency terms, the growth per capita reached 2,131,299/- last year up from 1,918,879/- which is an increase of 11.1 per cent, he said. According to him the GDP for 2016 was 103,744,606m/- at current prices while the Tanzania Mainland population was estimated at 48,676,698 people.Dr Mpango said the growth rate of the economy was 7.0 per cent, the same as was in 2015, albeit below the projected 7.2 per cent as some economic activities fell short of projected targets.He said that the agricultural sector, which accounted for 29.1 pecent share of the economy last year, grew by 2.1 per cent as compared to the projected 2.9 per cent.Trade and maintenance grew by 6.7 per cent against 7.8 per cent, food and accommodation services by 3.7 per cent instead of 8.0 per cent and administrative services by 2.1 per cent as compared to the 6.3 per cent projections, he said.However, there were economic activities which surpassed their targets which include information and communication 13 per cent against a projection of 12.1 per cent, transport and storage 11.8 per cent against 8.0 per cent, mining and quarrying 11.5 per cent against 9.2 per cent and manufacturing 7.8 per cent against the anticipated 6.7 per cent.On sectoral shares to the economy, the minister said that the agricultural sector, broadly defined to include crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries had 29.1 per cent shares to the economy last year compared to 29.0 per cent in 2015. Manufacturing and construction activities contributed 25.2 per cent to the economy last year up from 24.3 per cent in 2015.Service sector which includes trade and repairs, transportation and storage, hotel and accommodation, information and communications, finance and insurance, rental houses, health and education, accounted for 39.1 per cent down from 40.0 per cent recorded in 2015. The decline in the contribution of services sector and an increase in industrial activities is a testimony that concerted government efforts aimed at building an industrial economy are picking up pace with positive results in improved manufacturing sector production and productivity, he said.
