Last week, experts from the Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) in collaboration with Mwanza Regional Commissioner s Office organized a special workshop which was meant to sharpen skills of top officials from the three regions of the Lake Zone on the importance of Strategic Planning in their areas of operations.Since LGAs were legal entities of public service delivery, they were in principle responsible for provision of services such as health, water and sanitation, empowerment and many others that need strategic planning as part of performance improvement initiatives.Historically, the planning and implementation of LGAs activities are affected by decisions and planning made at the central level of the government. However, of recent, the government had adopted a number of transformation agendas which need to be integrated into LGAs Strategic Planning processes.Speaking as she gave the keynote speech, the ESRF Executive Director Dr Tausi Kida said the series of the workshops on the agenda for LGAs executives was of paramount importance especially now when the government implements crucial programs targeting to boost economic status of the country. These workshops are the continuation of the country wide capacity building programs as launched by the Ministry of Finance under its Poverty Reduction Department last year, to expose LGAs to techniques and procedures for undertaking their strategic planning, budgeting, and reporting taking into account the recently adopted National Planning Frameworks, she said.According to Dr Kida, lack of required strategic planning approaches was likely to cause serious effect to the implementation and proper adoption of development agendas mentioning them as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Africa Development Agenda 2063, and the second Five Year Development Plan (FYDP II 2015/16-2020/21).Experience has shown serious gaps in applying strategic planning during execution of various development programs in many LGAs, she said, challenging the workshop participants who included the Regional Administrative Secretaries (RASs) District Executive Directors (DEDs) and Planning Officers from Mwanza, Mara and Simiyu regions to work of the gained materials and empower their subordinates accordingly.They were initially introduced on the main topics that included situation analysis, strategic plans, budgeting, operational planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation and reporting which an important aspects since it involved communicating results to the management so that action could be taken to direction adjustment and performance improvement.It was revealed that government institutions in the country, have been reporting on their performance in compliance with statutory requirements but their reports tend to focus on implementation progress main on physical implementation of activities and expenditures rather than higher level results.The workshop was further informed that in order to improve the scope and quality of the reports and to better link reports to Strategic Plans and FYDP II, the government institutions, starting 2017/2018 will be required to report in more detail, on the performance against plans. In the process of reporting results, the Monitoring and Evaluation techniques outlined in this workshop will be needed to collect, manage, analyze, and interpret data. For this to happen, government institutions monitoring and evaluation sections and professionals will need to be capacitated by management in terms of crucial areas, read the paper in part.Capacity building for proper monitoring and evaluation will include adequate number of M&amp;E professionals, relevant skills, financial resources and modern equipment for data collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination. Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr John Mongela said as he opened the workshop that the materials on the subject were timely amid researches showing a number of challenges in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) last 15 years.One of the challenges according to the RC was the fact that the implementation of MDGs did not reach to the grassroots levels of the country s governance machinery particularly in the LGAs. It is due to this understanding that the LGAs breathed a sigh of relief seeing stakeholders like ESRF opting to work on the indentified challenges and make sure the snags noted in the implementation of MDGs are not repeated this time, he said.Mr Mongela though, said it was high time other development stakeholders, scholars and research institutions chipped in by conducting such knowledge sharing seminars and workshop to bring more awareness and understanding to a wider segment of the public and members in the civil service.
