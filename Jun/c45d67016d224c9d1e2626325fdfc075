Dr Mpango announced abolishment of the bothering annual motor vehicle licence fees and instead hiked the excise duty on petrol, diesel and kerosene by 40/- per litre. The new duties on fuel per litre on petrol, diesel and kerosene will effective July 1 be 379/-, 255/- and 465/-, respectively.The government also banned the direct exports of minerals from the mines, establishing clearing houses at international airports in the 2017/18 fiscal year to intensify efforts to control and increase revenues from the mineral resources.The widely decried Value Added Tax on transit goods was abolished as well. Dr Mpango said increased excise duty on fuel aims at compensating for the loss of revenues due to abolished annual motor vehicle licence fee.Members of Parliament clapped and cheered uncontrollably as the minister presented the government s fiscal plan, repelling the charges, which were a nuisance to many motorists. And, the best news indeed was when Dr Mpango announced amnesty to motorists with outstanding motor vehicles annual fees. I extend amnesty to all motorists who owe Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) annual (motor vehicle licence) fees.They will pay neither the fee nor the penalty, announced Dr Mpango amid deafening applause from the backbenchers, regardless of their political affiliations. The fee, he said, will be paid only during the first registration of the vehicle.But, he announced slight increase in registration fees to 200,000/- from 150,000/- for vehicles with between 500 and 1,500cc and 250,000/- for vehicles with between 1501 and 2500cc.Regarding the ban on direct mineral exports from mines, he said the move aims at boosting revenues from mineral resources, hinting that the government has introduced a one per cent clearing fee on the value of minerals.The minister proposed introduction of five per cent withholding tax on the total value of minerals to all small miners to ensure optimal collection of government revenues.Dr Mpango said the government would continue undertaking measures to strengthen and simplify revenue collection, citing introduction of the Government Electronic Payment Gateway System and Electronic Revenue Collection System (e-RCS).He directed all the ministries, government departments and institutions to start using the systems to strengthen and simplify revenue collection. He said the newly launched e-RCS would ensure proper assessment of taxes and provide assurance to the taxpayers on their tax liabilities.The system will start operating in the 2017/18 fiscal year under TRA and Tanzania, Communications Regulatory Authority and Zanzibar Revenue Board, he said. The government through TRA will continue collecting property tax for valued and non-valued houses in all local government authorities, the minister said, noting that the government will tax non-valued houses a flat rate of 10,000/- each and 50,000/- per each floor of a storey house.Players in the informal small businesses like food vending, second-hand cloth sale and agricultural produce sale will be issued with identity cards. Enforcement measures on the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs) by ministries, government departments and institutions and all businesses will be the priority of the government, which also plans to open an Escrow Account effective next month to ease refund of additional import 15 per cent duty that importers of industrial sugar pay on Free on Board value.Dr Mpango proposed VAT exemption on capital goods to reduce cost of procurement and importation of machines and plants for production, saying the exemption will apply to edible oil, textile, leather, and pharmaceutical industries.He also proposed zero rate VAT on ancillary transport services in relation to goods in transit to reduce the costs incurred by transporters and make Tanzania the preferred route for landlocked countries imports. He further proposed VAT exemption on locally produced compounded animal feed to reduce costs by livestock keepers and contribute to growth of the subsector.The minister also proposed extension of VAT extension to include fertilized eggs for incubation to reduce costs related to incubation and promote growth for the poultry sub-sector.He proposed reduction of corporate income tax for new assemblers of vehicles, tractors and fishing boats, from 30 to 10 per cent for the first five years of operations to increase employment, government revenues and facilitate technology transfer.In a deliberate move to ensure the country s major sea gateway -- Dar es Salaam port restores its glory that was recently threatened by competitors, the government has removed charges on goods on transit. Our aim is to reduce costs for transporters and make the business environment friendly, he said, noting that Dar es Salaam port has been a very important anchorage handling a lot of cargo to the landlocked countries.Transporters have been decrying high charges at the Dar es Salaam port, with some blaming them on lost businesses to the neighbouring ports. But, boozers and smokers will have to dig deeper into their pockets as the government hiked excise duty on local and imported beers.Excise duty on cigarettes both with and without filter tips containing domestic tobacco more than 75 per cent have also been raised from 11,854/- to 12,447/- and 28,024/- to 29,425/- per thousand cigarettes, respectively.The government also announced changes in common external tariffs including grant duty remission on wheat grain and applying duty rate of 10 per cent instead of 35 for one year.
