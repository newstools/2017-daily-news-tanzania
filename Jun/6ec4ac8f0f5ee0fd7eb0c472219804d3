Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa banned food exports on Monday when addressing the Eid-el-Fitr Baraza in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region, instructing relevant authorities to implement the order immediately.According to the PM, a finding established that as the long rain season ends there were areas in the country which did not get enough showers and were bound to be hit by famine.The RPC therefore led an inspection exercise on every truck at the border posts to determine what was being exported. If it was food an export and transportation permit was the only solution.Otherwise, anybody found ignoring the PM s order, according to Mr Seleman, his consignment will be confiscated. We are also conducting the war against dealers of illicit drugs at the borders where three people, who were found with khat and bhang were apprehended, said the RPC.He urged patriotic citizens to continue collaborating with the Police Force in revealing all suspects who go against the nation s laws.
