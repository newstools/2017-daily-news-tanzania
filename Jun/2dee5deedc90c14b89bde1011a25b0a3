He pointed out that severe actions would be taken against whoever would be conclusively established to have engaged in the misdeeds.Mr Mwaiteleke elaborated: If it turns out for certain that due diligence was not exercised in the tendering process, the committee would be taken to task, and its members may be compelled to refund to the government, the cost it had spent on the project so far. He said a letter had been circulated to water sector authorities in the region, instructing them to select an appropriate company for undertaking such projects, as an outcome of an above-board tendering process.
