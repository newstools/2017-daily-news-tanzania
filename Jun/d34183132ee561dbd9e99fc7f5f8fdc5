The Deputy Minister in the President s Office, (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr Suleiman Jaffo told Parliament yesterday that the money would be spent on construction of a water tank, water sewerage systems, fence, wiring system and water supply connections.Mr Jaffo was responding to Sixtus Mapunda (Mbinga Urban - CCM) who wanted to know when construction of the DC s office building would be completed. He said the government had been constructing the building for 10 years now. The government has been constructing the Mbinga DC s offices for a period of 10 years now I would like to hear from the government on when the building will be completed to allow the DC and other civil servants to continue with their daily activities in finished offices? he asked.He added that construction had since stopped for a long time and that the building was losing its quality. The MP asked the government to provide the allocated amount of money on time so that construction could take place as soon as possible. Allocating the money and providing it are two different things so I would like to ask the government to provide this money on time so that con struction could carry on without interruption, he said.In another development, Mr Joseph Selasini (RomboChadema), advised the government to provide all the money allocated for the construction of various district offices across the country so as to minimise re-evaluation costs and ensure value for money. We have been losing taxpayers money because we do not provide money on time, for example when you allocate funds for a certain project in this fiscal year and fail to provide it on time, building materials and other costs go up in the coming fiscal year, so the government needs to provide cash on time, he said.Ms Magdalena Sakaya (Kaliua CUF) said the Kaliua DC had been using the ward offices for years because the government had not finished constructing the DC s offices.In response, Mr Jaffo reiterated that the government was committed to ensuring that all district offices and other buildings in various councils were completed as planned.He said the government was also working hard to address challenges in various councils and that it was doing everything in its powers to allocate required funds to implement identified projects.So far, he said, the government had since dished out a total of 700m/- to for implementation of projects in various councils across the country.
