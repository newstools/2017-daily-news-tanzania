In a move to fight the challenge we have decided to introduce electronic system for inspecting and verifying motor vehicles Insurance. We ask for cooperation from the general public, said TIRA Marketing Manager, Ms Adelaida Muganyizi.She said TIRA s reforms including introducing e insurance aims at ensuring that all motor vehicles - cars, trucks, motorcycles and other road vehicles have genuine insurance stickers.At a meeting which involved police traffic officers, insurers and other members of the public she said that understanding e-insurance was important in ensuring that the reforms that seeks to promote transparency and exchange of information succeeds.During the campaign to sensitise the public and law enforcers on insurance business, in Unguja private cars and commuter buses (daladala) were inspected where more than 100 cars with fake insurance stickers were confiscated.Head of traffic unit in Unguja, Mr Mkadam Khamis Mkadam, called upon stakeholders to ensure the implementation of this important system for the development of motor insurance business, declaring zero tolerance to any person found using fake insurance sticker.However, Mr Omar Ali, a Daladala operator urged for more awareness campaigns to distinguish genuine insurance stickers from fake, proposed for severe legal and disciplinary actions against insurance companies officers who will be found to be part of the illegal network.
