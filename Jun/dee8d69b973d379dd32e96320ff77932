In a move to fight the chal-lenge, TIRA has introduced a new electronic system for inspecting and verifying motor vehicle and motorcycle Insurance which is known as TIRA, MIS.Speaking during the launch-ing of the mentioned system for Southern Highlands regions in Mbeya region this week, Nation-al Insurance Commissioner Dr Baghayo Saqware said that, the aim of having Insurance services is to make matters less difficult for people when they get accidents while on roads.Dr Saqware said that, there are official and genuine proce-dures for motor vehicle owners to get Insurance, and that after ful-filling the proceduresthey are provided with special stickers which indicate the office or Company which they had se-cured the Insurance. However, there are indi-viduals who are not faithful at all who are still issuing Insurances which are not connected with our system, which normally ends in causing a lot of disturbances when vehicle owners need Insur-ance services , he said.He continued to say that the new system will be a solution to Insurance agents who used to is-sue fake Insurances causing them to miss their rights of having In-surance services when they need them.In addition, he said these agents were causing individuals to lose trust in Insurance services.According to 2013 to 2016 sta-tistics, a total of 25 were arrested for dealing with fake Insurance business whereby five of them were jailed while the rest were ordered to pay fines
