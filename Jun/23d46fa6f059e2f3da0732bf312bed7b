Ms Mghwira becomes the first opposition RC and second person from ACT Wazalendo to be appointed by the President after Prof Kitila Mkumbo who was chosen in early April, this year, to be the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water and Irrigation.According to a press statement issued by the Director of Presidential Communications, Mr Gerson Msigwa, the newly appointed RC will fill the position which was left vacant by the Former Regional Commissioner, Mr Saidi Meck Sadiki.Commenting on the appointment, ACT Ideology, Publicity and Communication Secretary, Ado Shaibu said the slot has double face: individual and party level.He said Ms Mghwira who is currently in the United States attending a women conference, will decide whether to take up the post or not as an individual. As an individual she has the right to decide whether to take up the appointment or not, the choice is hers as it was the case with Dr Kitila Mkumbo, he said.At party level, we look at Ms Mghwira in a different outlook as was the case with Mkumbo s appointment. It is still controversial, as according to the ruling party, CCM regulations, the Regional Commissioner is the Chairperson of the Regional Security Council thus mandated to attend party meetings. He said they will meet within the next two days as Ms Mghwira is expected to return and chart a way forward as a party.In another development, the President has appointed Tanzania People s Defence Forces (TDPF) Commissioner for Operations and Training, Major General, Issah Suleiman Nassor and the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DGIP), Abdulrahman Omari Juma as ambassadors.The statement, however, stated that the date for their swearing in is yet to be announced.
