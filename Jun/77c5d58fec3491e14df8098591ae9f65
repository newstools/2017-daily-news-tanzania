Niyonzima spoke as a reaction to the rumours being circulated that he has signed with traditional rivals Simba, something he strongly refuted. Niyonzima told a reporter in Dar es Salaam that he was still a player of Yanga though he admitted to have held talks with Simba.He said he was shocked with the news that he had already signed with Simba while it was not true. We just held talks, but contract was signed as it was reported, he said. He said there was no any official agreement between him and the Msimbazi Street side apart from a meeting. I am still a Yanga player legally and I have never signed any contract with Simba, he added. Niyonzima, key player in his team s midfield section, said he was still on holiday with his family, therefore the voluminous news of his departure really shocked him.Born in Gisenyi, Rwanda on February 5, 1990, Niyonzima joined Young Africans in 2011 from APR the team he had been playing for since 2007.
