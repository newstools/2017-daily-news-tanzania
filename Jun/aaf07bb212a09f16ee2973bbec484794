The programme, which has been running for about seven years now, gives an opportunity to individuals with prior training, learning or job experience in a certain field but could not make it to higher learning institutions, to join a degree programme upon passing the examinations.TCU Spokesperson Edward Mkaku told the Daily News yesterday in a telephone interview that it was true that TCU invited candidates to register for the examinations under the stated programme.This newspaper sought confirmation of the advertisement from TCU after some individuals started expressing doubt over its authenticity in their discussions on various social networks. This programme which we have announced is not new at all.It has been there for about seven year now.According to Mr Mkaku, individuals, including media practitioners have benefited from it.Those interested were supposed to start lodging their applications from June 1 with the deadline set for June 24, this year, meaning that prospective candidates now have only 17 days to apply.Speaking on eligibility, he said candidates with a certificate of primary education must have completed and possess standard seven education certificate. They must also have practicedthe acquired knowledge for not less than five years and must have progressed to NTA Level 5, but should not possess qualifications to join diploma courses.Those with certificate of secondary education must have completed and possess certificate of secondary education and must also have attended any extramural classes.A five-year experience in the relevant field is also required.Prospective candidates with advanced certificates of secondary education must have completed and have an Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education, attended extramural classes and must have experience of not less than three years in the relevant field.
