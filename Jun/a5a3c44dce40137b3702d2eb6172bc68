This follows a recent judgment handed out by the Court of Appeal sitting at Dodoma, which dismissed in its entirety, the appeal by the three robber suspects but which was subsequently found to be devoid of any merit.Justices Bernard Luanda, Augustine Mwarija and Rehema Mkuye pointed out that any appeal was a creature of law and a person wishing to resort into such course has to comply with the law.According to the justices, criminal appeals from subordinate courts to the High Court were governed by section 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPA), which prescribes conditions to be fulfilled, one of which required a person who indents to appeal to give notice of intention to appeal within 10 days from the date of finding, sentence or order. In the case at hand, we entirely agree with the prosecution that the appellants did not give notice of any category of their intention to appeal to the High Court, the justices observed.They said that it would appear the appellants, out of ignorance, had not heeded to the advice given by the judge of the High Court for them to have applied extension of time to file the notice of appeal out of time and leave to file the appeal itself out of time. As it is, we agree with the learned judge that the appellant had, indeed, put the cart before the horse. In other words, this appeal was brought far prematurely, the justices declared.They, however, advised the appellants, if they so wished, to start afresh to process their appeal to the High Court by taking two steps, including making application for extension of time to give notice out of time and applying for leave to appeal out of time.It was alleged that on April 3, 2006, at about 06.10 hours at Urughu Village in Iramba District, the three appellants and others who were acquitted stole 19,000/-, the property of one Habiel Neema and immediately before or after the time of stealing, they threatened to use firearm and pangas.
