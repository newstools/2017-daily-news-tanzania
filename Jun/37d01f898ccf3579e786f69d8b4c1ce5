While the venue for tomorrow s venue for last respects has changed.Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Tulia Ackson, Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Professor Jumanne Maghembe, former Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner, Mr. Saidi Meck Sadiki, Kigamboni and Mlalo MPs, Dr Faustine Ndungulile and Rashid Shangazi respectively were among those who arrived yesterday.In her address to the fam-ily, party members and the mourners at the deceased s KDC Home, Dr Ackson passed condolences on behalf of the Parliament, saying the demise of Mzee Ndesamburo was a national issue, considering he has touched so many lives in his mentoring activities.She said much as his widow, children and his political party members were mourning, so it is for the nation at large, saying if everybody would get time to say what the late MP did for them, it would be too much to bear, as he did a lot to many, not only with Chadema or the opposition, but to Tanzanians.The deputy speaker said the fact that many leaders have called at KDC home since his passing illustrates how many people have been touched by the sad moment, although Kilimanjaro region and Moshi district could be a bit more affected. Those who got the opportu-nity to speak and work with him even for a short stint learnt a lot from him.There could be cir-cumstances where we speak of good things only after a person has passed on, but it is not the same for this noble man, even if he were alive he would hear the same, she said.The deputy speaker told those present that after multi-party politics were initiated in the country, Mr Ndesamburo took his duty well and worked to mentor leaders from the oppo-sition, but before that he did a lot with many from different spheres. He was really a guardian, a leader, he showed the way clearly and if one was wrong, he would not hesitate but speak out without fear to ensure one goes to the right path. That is why we are all in pain.However, we find comfort in the fact that what he taught us will forever remain, he has not left us empty-handed. He helped a lot, some with ideas but some financially, so we thank God for the gift of his life.God has seen it right that his journey ends here because he has completed his responsibilities.We have ourselves to ask, when our journey comes to an end, will we have accomplished our tasks?He counselled us well, that is why we should emulate him. We should not be bad to others, let us do good so that we mould others the way he did, said the deputy speaker.In another development, there seems to be some mis-understanding concerning the venue that will be used for mourners to pay their last respects tomorrow, as the Moshi Municipal Council declined permission to use Mashujaa Grounds.A letter signed on behalf of Moshi municipal director and addressed to Chadema Moshi District Chairman, Mr African Mlay said permission was given to use Majengo Ground that seems to be much better for the event for several reasons.
