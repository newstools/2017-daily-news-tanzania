In his speech before successfully moving a motion to adjourn the House session to September 27, this year, Mr Iddi said the move is aimed at reducing land conflicts and redistributing it to serious citizens and investors in need of land for development projects including industry, housing and agricultural activities. We have people including bigwigs holding onto huge chunks of land, which they have not developed for a long period. We have decided to revoke lease/ title deeds regardless of their position, the vice-president said as the legislators cheered in support of the move.Mr Iddi said, amid land conflicts in the Islands, some people were holding the much needed land for a long period, but many have left the land unused. Enough is enough, we have to bring back the land to the government for planned development programmes, he emphasised.He cautioned Zanzibaris about reckless use of land as the Islands are running out of space due to increasing demand caused by population boom, settlement and development projects and that people are required to follow land use master plan to minimise problems.In his 40 minutes speech, the vicepresident also stressed on financial discipline and observing ethics at work place in public offices. This follows complaints raised by backbenchers in the House about inappropriate use of funds and sabotage in some government offices including hospitals.It was said that filthiness, being rude to patients, shortage of medicines and frequent lack of x-rays and other screening services at Mnazi Mmoja main hospital was because of dishonesty among some staff who direct patients to private hospitals (where doctors and nurses also work during their extra hours) for personal gains.Mr Iddi said, Investigations are underway to fish out dishonest medical staff at Mnazi Mmoja and other public offices. The government will have zero tolerance to any of them taking part in sabotage yet the government has been allocating enough funds to improve health services in the country. During the session which started last month, legislators approved 1.08tril/- national budget for the 2017/2018 fiscal year alongside endorsing, Appropriation Bill, Financial Bill, Stamp Duty (amendment) Bill and Excise Duty bill.
