This follows the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss in its entirety the appeal he had lodged to fault findings of the High Court on the criminal trial.In a judgment delivered recently, Justices Kipenka Mussa, Richard Mziray and Gerald Ndika, confirmed both conviction and sentence imposed having realised that the appeal lacked merits. The offence of rape of a girl under 18 years of age was proven beyond doubt. Consequently, we sustain the appellant conviction and uphold the sentence imposed on him, they declared.In his appeal, Manoko, the appellant, had advanced two grounds to challenge the decision of the High Court, which had not only dismissed the first appeal but also enhanced the jail term from 30 years to life sentence.The appellant had submit ted that the cautioned statement under which he was alleged to have admitted the offence was wrongly admitted, as it was made after the prescribed time of interview had elapsed.He had further told the court that both the lower courts wrongly based their decisions upon hearsay evidence of the mother of the victim (name withheld) following irregular admission of the medical examination report.In the judgment dated May 23, 2017, the justices noted two things on the complaint relating to admission of the cautioned statement, notably the appellant s express position of having no objection when the document was tendered in court as exhibit.According to them, during hearing of the appeal the appellant did not give any factual basis of his contention that the cautioned statement was recorded beyond the allowable statutory period of interrogation. It is apt to recall that at his trial he remained silent and therefore he did not offer his version on how and when he was arrested and interrogated by the police. Given the circumstances, we did not find any indication that the statement was obtained irregularly, they said.As far as the second complaint on the admissibility of medical report indicating how the victim was sexually suffered, the justices noted that the requirement of the law was not complied with and thus, they decided to exclude such evidence in the record.But they were quick to point out that medical evidence was not the only proof of sexual offence. In the case in hand, the justices noted how the mother of the victim gave a graphical account of how she found her daughter shortly after the unlawful sexual act was committed. Intriguingly, the appellant did not cross-examine this witness, which implies his acceptance of the truthfulness of that testimony. In the cautioned statement, the appellant confessed to have raped (the victim), thereby causing her excessive bleeding from her private parts, they noted.
