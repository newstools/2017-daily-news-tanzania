According to a detailed description of the ambitious programme released during a workshop held for top management of local government authorities from 12 regions held here recently, the whole project which is staggered on four financing components is aimed at making the envisaged agricultural revolution a reality.Owning out that it comes out of a past failure, ASDP II would avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor: poor financing and lack of coordination, and the current documents point out that 65 to 75 per cent of the project would be directed to the LGAs through strict supervision of the President s Office. The programme financing is executed through the basket fund arrangement one of the most integrated and expedient financing mechanisms to implement a comprehensive agricultural development programme, the documents read in part.The basket funding mechanism is also preferred because it avoids a fragmented system of financing with separate projects being funded by a range of different development partners.While the LGAs would get a huge percentage of the fiveyear programme, the rest of the funds will be directed to the regional secretariats and agricultural sector lead agencies, Ministries (ASLMs) with 20 to 25 per cent of the funding.The four components, with their estimated allocations include: Sustainable Water and Land Use Management (2.024trl/-, or 15 per cent of the programme cost); Enhanced Agriculture Productivity ( 8.081trl/- or 58 percent of overall programme cost); Commercialisation and Value Chain Addition (1.4trl/- of overall costs); and Strengthening Sector Enablers (137bn/- equivalent to one per cent of the programme cost).Initially scheduled to commence by 2015/2016 to 2024/2025, the ASDP II is anchored on the Tanzania LongTerm Perspective Plan (LTPP), and build on lessons (of past failures) from the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS I). The programme implements the Tanzania Development Vision 2025 whose higher goal is to achieve favourable contribution to the national economic growth, reduced rural poverty and improved food security and nutrition in the country, the document stressed.Under ASDP II, it is proposed that both internal and external monitoring and evaluation machinery would be introduced, with a national coordination management team being formed to coordinate national joint annual reviews and evaluations of the programme, among other things.
