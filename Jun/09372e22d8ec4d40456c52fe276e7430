Chadema National Chairman Freeman Mbowe confirmed here yesterday that they have accepted the venue change from Mashujaa Grounds as directed by Moshi Municipal Council that owns both grounds.The party had initially planned to host the event at Mashujaa, arguing that the place is centrally located, and even its name connotes what Mzee Ndesamburo has been.Mashujaa grounds is as well generally preferred for many public activities.Party supporters made it to the place and made cleaning on Saturday before noon.However, a letter signed on behalf of Moshi municipal director and addressed to Chadema Moshi District Chairman, Mr African Mlay said permission was given to use Majengo grounds that were described as better for the event, with several reasons advanced.The letter said that Mashujaa Ground is near a court and school, considering that the event takes place on a working day amid continuing government activities, with thousands of mourners from different parts of the country, it was not advisable to use the ground.Chadema members and leaders initially disagreed with the municipal council directive, claiming that the matter was politically handled and dismissed the advanced reasons as baseless.However, Mr Mbowe quelled the debates by stating that they had settled for Majengo Grounds, albeit reluctantly. Members again started cleaning and setting up tents from Saturday evening through yesterday, ready for today s event.Mr Ndesamburo who passed on at about 1045hrs of May 31 at Kilimanjaro Christian Centre (KCMC) was aged 82 and was regional chairman for the party and retired MP who served three terms for Moshi Urban constituency until 2015.
