The global trade event which is cohosted by the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication will host over 350 senior clearing agents and freight forwarders, business delegates, government officials, ambassadors and trade representatives from Africa and Middle East.The Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Prof Makame Mbarawa yesterday lauded Tanzania Freight Forwarders Association (TAFFA) s efforts in showcasing much needed awareness especially in the transport sector which is a lifeline of any great nation as it supports movement of people and goods. Bringing the GLS 2017 to our doorstep is a great achievement and also an essential opportunity for businesses, especially now when our government is pushing hard for increase of trade in the country and across the continent, said the minister.TAFFA President, Mr Stephen Ngatunga, said Tanzania will showcase its true potential as an ideal transportation hub to the global community, while bringing about interactions, business meetings, exchange of ideas and contacts among maritime stakeholders across the continent. Interactions among importers, exporters, shipping firms and freight forwarders, among several others will ultimately lead to increase in maritime activities in Tanzania, thereby helping the country attain the desired hub port status within the sub-regions and ultimately advance the Tanzanian economy, he said.This summit comes at a time when Tanzanian businesses need increased awareness and knowledge on best practices to use especially in a digitally inclusive world where technology is king.There are vast opportunities for business growth to be unlocked in Tanzania in terms of clearing and freight forwarding especially if landlocked countries of Burundi, DRC, Rwanda and Uganda plus southern African countries utilize Dar es Salaam through the Northern route and vice versa as a freight cargo transportation hub. As TAFFA, we are making strides in empowering businesses through programmes such as the GLS where renowned professors from the likes of Harvard University will impart knowledge on international freight forwarding industry and best practices. This is a first for us to host such a global event.
