Chairperson of the EAC Council of Ministers, Alhaj Kirunda Kivenjija told reporters here yesterday that the fourth EALA session was expected to be convened on June 5, 2017 but was apparently put off – soon after the third EALA session ended on June 4, 2017. “This did not happen because of two factors, namely, that one of the partner states (Kenya) had by that date not elected its nine members … and, upon an application by a citizen of South Sudan, the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) issued an interim order to the EAC not to recognize the nine members who were said to have been elected to EALA,” said Alhaj Kivenjija. The chairman who is also deputy Prime Minister and Minister of EAC Affairs of Uganda noted that upon hearing of the matter by EACJ the applicant withdrew the application on grounds that the Republic of South Sudan had revoked the election of its members and committed to hold fresh elections by end of June. “As a result of the foregoing, the 4th Assembly could not commence on 5th June 2017 and has not been able to convene due to legal circumstances namely incomplete membership of the Assembly and the inability to hold a session of the first meeting of the Assembly,” he said. Membership of the Assembly is required by Article 48 (1) of the Treaty for the Establishment of the EAC, among others, to be composed of nine elected members from each partner state. In the present circumstances there are 18 members missing from Kenya and South Sudan. He said that as of now the Assembly is yet to attain full membership given that two partner states are yet to elect their members and the Assembly is unable to convene a session of the first meeting and transact business as required under Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly. Alhaj Kivenjija said that administration of oath cannot be done to members of the four partner states and that the Clerk is constrained to convene a sitting of the Assembly when fully aware that the Assembly is not fully constituted and cannot transact any business.
