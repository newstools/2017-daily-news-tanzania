Announcing the move at a press conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday, TFF Interim General Secretary, Salum Madadi, said the decision was reached yesterday by the Executive Committee, which held an emergence meeting to deliberate on various issues, including an impasse on the federation s election process.According to Madadi, the committee has dropped four members of the Election Committee, including Vice-Chairperson, Domina Madeli, members - Juma Lallika, Jeremiah Wambura and Hamim Mahmoud Omar, allegedly for, among other reasons, breach of ethical conduct.However, the Chairman of the committee, Revocatus Kuuli, has been retained and he will now work with new members who are Rufiji Member of Parliament (MP) Mohamed Mchengerwa, Advocate Malangwe Ally Mchungahela, Advocate Kiomoni Kibamba, who is also Mwanza City Director and Advocate Thadeus Kalua.Madadi insisted that the planned August 12th general election in Dodoma will be staged as planned no matter the circumstances and that the election process will resume shortly.The election process came to an abrupt stop on Sunday after the election committee suspended it until further notice. The move was announced by the Committee s Chairman, Revocatus Kuuli amid chaos during an exercise to vet candidates. In accordance with powers vested to the chairman, I want to take this opportunity to announce that the election process has been stopped until on Tuesday afternoon (yesterday) when the Executive Committee will hold an emergency meeting and come up with a final say, Kuuli, who openly differed with his assistant, said.Kuuli revealed that the main motive behind the pause of the election process was the fact that many aspirants were chopped out from the race without sound reasons, probably to please certain individuals and that some rules set aside to be followed during election time were abandoned.Kuuli was forced to halt all election processes after disputes with his fellow committee members, fighting for inclusion of names of the aspirants detained in custody allegedly for being involved in money laundering and fraud. The aim is to solve the dispute and legal conflict and the election process will resume after the matter is settled, Kuuli said.Other committees that have experienced minor changes include Disciplinary and Appeals Committee, whose members are Rahim Shaban, Siza Abdallah Chenja, Abbas Mtemvu, Aman Idd Mulika and Stella Mwakingwe.Disciplinary Committee has Chairman Tarimba Abbas, Pe ter Hella, Boniface Lyamwike, Billy Haonga, Kassim Dau, while Ethics Appeals Committee will be led by Advocate Ebenezer Mshana, DCP Mohamed Mpinga, Advocate Benjamin Karume, Lisobina Kisongo and ASP Benedict Nyagabona.Advocate Hamad Mbwezeleni will head Ethics Committee, while other members of the committee are Advocate Steven Francis Zangira, Glorius Luoga, Walter Luoga and Amin Bakhressa Madadi said Advocate Abdi Kagomba will lead Election Appeals Committee whose other members are Advocate Kenneth Mwenda, Advocate Rashid Sadalla, Jabir Shekimweli and Mohamed Gombati.Both TFF president Jamal Malinzi and his Secretary General Selestine Mwesigwa, together with TFF accountant, Nsiande Mwanga, are still in custody after they were denied bail on Monday.Malinzi and Mwesigwa are facing 28 counts of fraud and money laundering of 375,418 US dollars (about 800m/-).
