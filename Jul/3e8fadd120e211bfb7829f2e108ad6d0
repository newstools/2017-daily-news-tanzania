The recommendation was made recently in Dar es Salaam by the TCRA Director General, Engineer James Kilaba, during a special interview on complaints raised by mobile phones users on adverts offered by mobile phone companies before a client call is connected.Eng. Kilaba said that the regulator has already written to all mobile phone companies to inform them on the matter and invite them for discussions to see how the problem can be tackled. As communications regulator we are aware of the matter and some customers have been complaining that such adverts cause inconveniences, especially when a person has an emergency and need to be connected directly instead of listening to adverts and music from the operators. Giving further clarification on the matter, Eng. Kilaba urged the mobile phone operators who have been inserting such adverts to halt them to avoid the inconveniences encountered by subscribers.The TCRA boss cited an example of such adverts such as Jaza Ujazwe or other business adverts run by some of the mobile phone companies in the country, which come before a caller is connected as not appropriate.The caller needs to be connected directly with the connecting ringtone or a busy tone whenever the number dialed is busy or be informed that the number is not reachable instead of giving him or her a series of adverts.According to Eng. Kilaba, TCRA is expecting to meet with the mobile phone companies which are operating in the country on July 6 to discuss the matter and give directives and resolutions on the matter.However, Eng. Kilaba unveiled that business adverts are not but the only problem with the adverts is where they are slotted by the operators and that has been a major problem to many of their customers.
