The public college will offer the courses in collaboration with the Canadian Government, with the views address the shortage of gas experts in the country.ATC Public Relations Officer Gasto Loseiyo said here over the weekend that the college will under the threeyear courses train students on industrial and household gas operations, oil and hydroelectric power.Mr Loseiyo was optimis tic that in a short period the country will get enough experts on the fields, helping the government to realise its target to industrialise the national economy.He said the college has resolved to proactively deal with the shortage of experts in different fields that are necessary for the country s industrialisation drive and use of gas as main source of power.The spokesperson argued that the college s strategies were aligned with the national industrialisation policy and development vision, saying a recent research has established that the nation is in dire need of gas experts.He described as unhealthy for the country to solely rely on foreign experts, charging that the gas and industrial sectors are golden opportunities to create jobs for Tanzanians.The programmes come amid the country s discovery of gas in different parts of the country. The government is expected to pay a great percentage of fees for selected students pursuing the course.ACT Head of Mechanical Engineering Department Nicholaus Mgusa noted with concern that most of the experts working on the Songosongo-Dar es Salaam gas pipeline are from India, due to unavailability of qualified Tanzanians.He said Chinese dominated the gas project from Mtwara to Dar es Salaam. For the envisaged oil pipeline from Hoima, Uganda to Tanga, Tanzania will need engineers and technicians, said Mr Mgusa, hinting that the programmes will equip Tanzanians with the required expertise.Head of Electric and Power Engineering Department Kefa Mkongwe described the courses as unique in East Africa, saying students will get good fieldwork training at ATC owned Kikuletwa Power Production Plant in Hai district, Kilimanjaro region.Tanzania and German governments jointly established ATC in 1978. The institution boasts of widely acclaimed reputation in producing work-ready, competent graduates capable of meeting the employers demands.
