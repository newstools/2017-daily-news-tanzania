The Director of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness with the Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), Dr Dugushilu Mafunda said here that many people have engaged themselves in entrepreneurship but without proper employment of science and technology, hence failing.The specialised engi neer in innovation in entrepreneurship was speaking at a workshop that brought together stakeholders to discuss how to use technology in the wake of economic and social reforms as the country aims at industrialisation. Many entrepreneurs are eager to be innovative as they want to beat market competition but some do not know how to go about it. We have no way but to embrace science and technology, he said, adding that a difference between developed countries and developing countries is in terms of application of technologies and innovations.He urged the businesspersons to register and get quality brand in their products from Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS), saying some have tried to come up with good products but without TBS certification, it is difficult to win markets.Dr Mafunda said that Costech has been supporting entrepreneurs by offering expertise in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) that arms many in the business competition and overcome challenges they face.The commission runs the workshops in different parts of the country, identifying challenges people face and turn them into business opportunities, he said. An ICT Consultant, Mr Makange Mramba said there are many innovative entrepreneurs in the country but they only lack financial muscle and ICT abilities that would catapult their work to success.He said it is sad that financial institutions do not give priority to small entrepreneurs; as a result their innovation is taken over by other people including foreigners. Mr Mramba urged financial institutions to change their mindset and support small entrepreneurs to grow.
