This comes at a time when fear was running high among the public, especially motorists over an expected hike in fuel prices, given the fact that the implementation of the new government budget starts today.Speaking to reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) Communications Manager Titus Kiguo said the decrease in prices was attributed to the fall of oil prices on the world market.According to Mr Kaguo, retail price of petrol has gone down by 37/- per litre while that of diesel has decreased by 4/- per litre. The pump price of kerosene has been reduced by 19/- per litre.With such margins of price decreases, the retail petrol price in Dar es Salaam Region will sell at 2,014/- per litre while diesel and kerosene will sell at 1,874/-and 1,806/-per litre, respectively.According to him, retail and wholesale prices of petrol and diesel for Tanga Region have increased compared to prices that were published on June 7, this year. Retail prices in the region for petrol and diesel have increased by 43/- per litre and 4/- per litre, respectively.Likewise, the wholesale prices for petrol and diesel have increased by 43.07/- (equivalent to 2.33 per cent) and 3.81/- (equivalent to 0. 22 per cent), respectively. The increases in local pump prices in Tanga are attributed to the increase in world oil market prices of the new consignment received through Tanga Port compared to the prices of the last consignment that was received in April, this year, Mr Kaguo explained.As a result of not having new shipment of kerosene received through Tanga Port in June, this year, EWURA, advised oil dealers in Tanga to source the product from Dar es Salaam.Mr Kaguo warned oil dealers against any foul play in the business as the indicative prices took on board the excise duty imposed by the government in the new budget to compensate for the scrapped annual motor licence fee.In its 2016/2017 budget the government duties per litre were 339/- for petrol and 215/- for diesel. Kerosine had 425 /- imposed as excise duty per litre. With an increase of 40/- in excise duty in this new budget the new duties on fuel per litre on petrol, diesel and kerosene effective today will be 379/-, 255/- and 465/-, respectively, he elaborated.He said oil marketing companies are free to sell their products at prices which give them competitive advantage provided that the prices do not exceed the price cap, warning that stern measures will be taken against foul players.Mr Kaguo also reminded retailers to issue receipts with respect to all sales they make. He also reminded consumers to demand and keep receipts. Oil prices in Tanzania are released every month by EWURA in line with Section 166 of the Petroleum Act of 2015.Last week, the Parliament passed the 2017/18 budget in which the government imposed an excise duty amounting to 40/- per litre on petroleum after scrapping an annual motor licence fee.The scrapping of the licence fee by the government was welcome by car owners across the country, given the fact that they were duty bound to pay for the fee for the grounded vehicles as well.
