In his reply to the counteraffidavit filed before the High Court s Commercial Division in Dar es Salaam last week, Mr Mabanga stated that his documents were genuine and were manufactured by (Ophir Energy PLC, Ophir Services PTY Limited) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, respectively. Among the documents includes an internal memo under which Ophir s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director, Mr Nick Cooper, is quoted as stating that the local businessman played a good role for his company to acquire gas Blocks One, Three and Four within the region. It should be noted that from the first day we made it very clear that we know Mr Mabanga very well. (He) was our man in Tanzania, who played a good role in ensuring we acquire the assets there, he states in the memo sent to Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden.Mr Cooper stated that it was a fact that Mr Mabanga, who was introduced to Ophir by one of their business partners, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, also a prominent businessman and politician in South Africa, used his connections (in Tanzania) to secure the assets (the three gas blocks). As you might be aware doing business in Africa sometimes requires more than financial muscles, because you need to have good guys who know how to secure good deals. In this case, Mr Mabanga was our good guy before the big bosses decided to pay him off, he states.The Ophir boss states in the memo, dated May 9, 2017, that Mr Mabanga was assigned and paid during the whole period when he was handling all their entry moves to Tanzania and that the big bosses decided to pay him off to pave way for further development of their assets.In the counter-affidavit by Angela Caramaschi, for BG Tanzania Limited, gave a con flicting version in regard to the documents in question, stating that they were doubtful .Mr Mabanga has urged the court to join Royal Dutch Shell, a global conglomerate based in The Hague, Netherlands, that acquired shares in Ophir s three gas blocks, and four others in the 13tril/- gas exploration deal landmark case involving three gas blocks offshore in Mtwara Region.Other defendants to be joined are Ophir Tanzania (Block 1) Limited, Ophir Tanzania (Block 3) Limited, Ophir Tanzania (Block 4) Limited and Pavilion Energy Pte. The businessman further seeks for orders to remove BG Tanzania Limited and add BG International Limited in the suit.However, three respondents are putting up spirited resistance against application, to wit: Ophir Energy PLC, Ophir Services PTY Limited and BG Tanzania Limited, who allege in their respective counter-affidavits that the move amounted to making up a new case.In response to the counteraffidavit, Mr Mabanga states that amendments should be allowed to achieve the purpose of sorting out the real controversy between the parties, considering the fact that Shell own the controlling stakes in the gas blocks which he is claiming his undercut five per cent free carry interest.According to Mabanga, his case remained the same that the consultancy agreements were unlawfully terminated by fraud, duress and misrepresentation committed upon him and paid the undercut amount, compared to the true value of the gas blocks at the time.In the suit, Mr Mabanga seeks for appointment of com petent International Oil and Gas Experts to determine value of his entitlement in the three gas blocks One, Three and Four in Southern Tanzania.He claims to be deceived fraudulently to surrender his interests in the blocks. According to him, he was coerced to sign a termination agreement to receive undervalued consideration of 7.5 million USD, thus depriving his rights to own property on fair payment and was forced out of the new corporate set up by xenophobic means because he was an African.
