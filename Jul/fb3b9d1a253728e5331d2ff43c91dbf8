Christened the trapping barrier system the device is the product of SUA s Pest Management Centre - which came up with this simple device to help farmers increase production - with a view to feeding the country s envisaged industry economic boom.Rats have become a serious challenge to the rice farmers across the country, as a result of which farmers now harvest less than expected yields. For instance, when a farmer targets to harvest 1,000kg of rice, they may end up with a paltry 200kg or even less, Dr Christopher Sabuni, a researcher at the centre said, in a short interview with the Daily News at the ongoing Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) yesterday. For a farmer to lose such a colossal amount of harvest is a serious matter, he added. Explaining how the trap works, Dr Sabuni said just a single trap was needed, placed strategically on an acre planted with seeds.Within that one acre plot, a farmer needs to allocate 10 square metres within which to plant the rice for luring the rats. When they come to eat it they get trapped, he explained.The trap could net as many as 15 rats at a go, so an enterprising farmer could catch all rats within his farm, Dr Sabuni said. The researchers are currently putting final touches to the system at some pilot villages to test its effectiveness before they could transfer the technology across the country.
