Onesmo Kayanda said yesterday in Dar es Salaam during a seminar organised by the council that the aim of the agreement is to support the government effort in revenue collections. We have entered into a joint venture with Yono Auction Mart, who will assist us in collecting revenues from artistes and arts stakeholders, said Kayanda.Kayanda said that the council alone could manage to ensure all the required taxes are collected as per the rules and regulations of the country due to inadequate manpower. We believe in the experience of Yono Auction Mart and the good thing is that they are positive to the exercise to reach a desired goal.Adding, Yono Auction Mart Managing Director Scholastica Kevela acknowledged the council to have confidence in them and promised to do the work perfectly so as to ensure the target is met. According to Basata, the two sides signed the agreement on the matter on June 26 this year that gave the Dar es Salaam auction mart firm a mandate to collect tax from artistes and arts stakeholders.Kayanda further clarified that the areas to be involved include entertainment halls, night clubs, music with exception of religious ones such as Gospel choir and Qaswida. He said Basata discovered many stakeholders conducting their businesses illegally and warned them of punitive measures since what they do is the Council s regulation of 1984 section 23.
