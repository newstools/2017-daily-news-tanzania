The move came a few days after the club s President, Evance Aveva and his Deputy Geofrey Nyange Kaburu were put under police custody on Wednesday and appeared before Kisutu Resident Magistrate s court on Thursday accused of forgery and money laundering.The duo are being held after they were accused of forgery and money laundering of 300,000 US dollars (about 600m/-). They are expected to reappear in court on July 13 this year.With the absence of Evance Aveva and Geofrey Nyange at the helm of the Msimbazi Street based team, the executive committee was forced to meet and agreed to pick Salim Abdallah, popularly known as Try Again , who is among the founders of Friends of Simba . There are some areas we looked at before electing Try Again as Acting President of our club. At first we planned to appoint Kassim Dewji who is also a member of executive committee, but he denied. After some discussions, we agreed to elect Salim Abdallah and Idd Kajuna as the president and the vice-president respectively, he said.The constitution of Simba says that when the President and his Deputy are not present, then a long serving member of executive committee should be elected to fill the gap.It is alleged that such offence was committed on March 15, last year, in the city. With intent to defraud or deceit, the accused persons allegedly purported to show that Simba SC was repaying a loan of the said 300,000 US dollars to Aveva, while it was not true.The prosecution alleged further that on the same day at CRDB Bank PLC, Azikiwe Branch in Ilala District, knowingly and fraudulently, Aveva uttered the said form to the bank, purporting that the club was repaying the said amount as loan to him.It is alleged that between March 15 and July 29, 2016, in Dar es Salaam, jointly and together, the two club leaders conspired to commit the offence of money laundering by acquiring the said 300,000 US dollars, while they knew that the money was proceeds of a predicate offence of forgery.The court heard further that on March 15, 2016, at Barclays Bank Tanzania Limited at Mikocheni Branch in Kinondoni District, Aveva acquired the said money from the Bank, while at the time of such acquisition, he knew the money was proceeds of offence of forgery.
