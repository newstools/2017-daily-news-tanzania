The launch of Norway s new commitment to support the tax modernisation programme under the cooperation between the royal government of the Kingdom of Norway and Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) was held in Dar es Salaam on Friday.Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango, said that the launching of the programme was the result of an agreement which was entered into between the two governments on October 23, 2012 whereby the Royal Kingdom accepted to support various programmes in Tanzania, including an initiative to support the modernisation programmes of TRA. As TRA embarks into implementing the fifth Corporate Plan (CP5) come July 1, 2017, much of your support is needed. I am pleased to hear that your government has come to the fore and become the first development partner to commit resources towards its implementation.Adding, I am told you are committing a total of 90 million Norwegian Kroner for three years to support this plan. This financial assistance will go a long way towards bridging the financing gap of implementing CP5 initiatives.He said that the fund will be located in the improvement of tax collection equipment and in providing training to TRA staff so as to increase efficiency.The Finance Minister pointed out that TRA is now boasting of being one of the models in Tax Administration in the region in terms of quality of service delivery, domestic revenue mobilisation, automation of key TRA operations and enhancing staff skills.It is through this agreement that TRA and the Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA) signed an agreement on May 27, 2013 for institutional cooperation.
