The Deputy Head of Mission of the Embassy of Germany, Mr John Reyels, assured potential investors from his country that Tanzania is the country of peace and is located strategically for market accessibility in other neighbouring country. He was speaking this week at the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) when introducing the German Pavilion. Their participation in the 41st trade fair marks their comeback after failing to take part in a number of such events in the past. “We welcome German companies to come back and use this trade fair as a platform to market themselves,” he said. He further revealed that plans were underway to open a branch of the German Industry and Commerce in Dar es Salaam in October, this year. The presence of the branch in Tanzania is expected to cement trade relations between the countries. According to the country director of the German Industry and Commerce in Kenya, Ms Maren DialeSchellschmidt, the branch will be officially opened in November.
