This, therefore, means that availability of drugs is something that should not be questionable, but guaranteed for any nation to have a healthy population. Though facing some inevitable challenges, the government in this country has worked hard to ensure availability of drugs especially to the ordinary man and the rural folk.It is unfortunate that history has it that we have had some unscrupulous medical staff who created artificial shortages at medical centres for their pharmacies across the road to benefit. Though this has become a thing of the past during this Fifth Phase Government, more still needs to be done to ensure steady medical supplies.And, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa assured the nation of improved availability of medical drugs and supplies in public hospitals, thanks to allocation of sufficient funds. The Premier said while addressing a public rally in Liwale District on Monday that the government is committed to ensure that all patients visiting public hospitals, health centres and dispensaries are getting essential services including medicines.He said improvement of health services is one of the government priorities, maintaining that all councils in the country are required to disburse funds for drug purchases. The assurance by the Premier over medical drugs availability is a right move towards improving the health sector in the country.It, however, remains imperative that those mandated to make sure that drugs are available, work hard to support the government s efforts. The government alone cannot accomplish this without the support of various workers in key areas and the public in general.It is well known that there are some unscrupulous medical practitioners who might try to take advantage and divert the drugs or sabotage the whole process for their personal benefit, so there is need to put in place follow up measures that will make sure that this goal is achieved.The general public on the other hand can play a pivotal role in curbing the problem by reporting all hospitals or health centres that will go without drugs for a long time. They should also report any suspected fishy dealings with drugs and make sure that they get medicines every time they seek treatment.It is important, therefore, that everyone plays his or her part to ensure a sustainable and stable supply of drugs for the benefit of the general public.
