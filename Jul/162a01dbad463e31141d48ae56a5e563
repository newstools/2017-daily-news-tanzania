Dr Shein issued the directive when he hosted leaders from the Ministry of Lands, Water, Energy and Environment, Zeco management and Board of Directors in the State House here.The President said it was high time the Isles electricity supplier put more efforts in doing profitable business, insisting that it was within the corporation s ability. He challenged the corporation to recover all its debts from power consumers and take stern measures against defaulters, including power disconnection.Dr Shein also ordered Zeco management to continue clearing its outstanding debts with the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (TANESCO), saying his government will keep providing money to Zeco as part of the monthly debt payment scheme to the Union power firm.Tabling the government budged for the 2017/18 fiscal year in the House of Representatives last month, Zanzibar Finance and Planning Minister, Dr Khalid Mohamed said the Isles expects to offset the debt by June next year.In an effort to settle the debt, Zanzibar has already paid 10bn/- to Tanesco out of the 65.6bn/-, Dr Mohamed informed the parliament.Zeco Director Hassan Ali Mbarouk assured the President that the Isles power firm is taking appropriate measures to increase revenue collections, through debt collections as well as improve power supply and connectivity across the Islands.Earlier, Zeco Board of Directors Chairman Mussa Haji told the President that within the past one year, they have succeeded to supply electricity to 47 villages in Unguja and Pemba.Meanwhile, President Shein has challenged the management of Zanzibar Water Authority (ZAWA) to address the acute water shortage in the Isles. President Shein made the call here yesterday when he met ZAWA management, saying the water supply problem was affecting the lives and daily activities of Zanzibaris.Reliable supply of clean and safe water remain one of the biggest challenges facing the Tanzania s semi-autonomous archipelago and the vice has often been blamed on persistent outbreak of cholera in Zanzibar.Whilst the government has embarked on a number of efforts to address water crisis, the service has not reached the majority of Islanders, especially in rural areas. Dr Shein directed WAZA management to find answers to the existing challenges that impede the water sub-sector and ensure that Zanzibaris get clean and safe water.Determined to increase water supply, the government plans to implement a rainwater harvesting scheme, the President said.
