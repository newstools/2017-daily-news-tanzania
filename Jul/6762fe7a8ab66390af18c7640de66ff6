As global temperatures rise, water in natural springs also gets warmer, leading to formation of some types of salty chemicals that when mixed with rain water turn into fluoride thus pushing up the content of the latter in the otherwise fresh liquids, says Prof Alfred Muzuka of NM-AIST.Prof Muzuka was submitting report to the ongoing regional workshop held at Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) campus here and organized by the University of Cagliari, the Sahara and Sahel Observatory, OIKOS East Africa and the host Nelson Mandela African Institute.The regional workshop brings together 14 partners from seven countries including 4 African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tunisia, Tanzania), Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.About 60 participants are participating in the event, including national and local authorities (Ministry of water and irrigation, Arusha Region), research organizations, local stakeholders in water and agriculture, NGO s, small and medium enterprises.The workshop is highly interactive and participatory, delving into water defluoridation technologies that could provide a feedback to the project activities.Participants will share and disseminate the information generated by the project and its intermediate results and outputs to raise public awareness on the deFluoridation technologies for improving water and agro-animal products, thus improving livelihood conditions of the population.So far, the -rural district councils of Meru, Longido and Arusha have been listed as having the highest concentrations of fluorine within their water reserves-- with the contamination ranging between five to 30 milligrams per litre.While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1.5 milligram of fluoride per litre of water, in Tanzania the permitted content may reach up to four milligrams per litre.But for Meru and Longido, the concentration ran up to 20 milligrams per litre in the course of this week alone-five times the national mean average.Already, the effects of fluoride are clearly seen among many residents of Longido and Meru districts, which include pre-mature aging, hard-bended backbone, bow-leggedness, bone fragility, crouching anatomies, large heads and other permanent body disfigurations.The AUWSA managing director, Engineer Ruth Koya had earlier stated that the local areas has potential water resources but much of that had very high fluoride, content making it difficult for the water authority to explore and drill new wells to sources supplies in Arusha.AUWSA has already floated tenders for the purchase of fluoride removing, water treating plants and according to its Director, one such machine capable of purifying 50 cubic litres per day, costs an astounding 600 million/-.The FLOWERED project, which stands for: deFluoridation technologies for improving quality of Water and agro-animal products along the East African Rift Valley in the context of adaptation to climate change is a three- year project (June 2016 May 2019), funded by the European Union and coordinated by the University of Cagliari (Italy).It also aims at contributing to the development of a sustainable water management system in areas affected by fluoride contamination in water, soils and food in the African Rift Valley countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania), thus to improve living standards (environmental, health and food security) of its population.FLOWERED aims to study, test and implement innovative de-fluoridation technologies for drinking and irrigation water that will mainly operate at small village scale and to develop an integrated, sustainable and participative water and agriculture management at a cross-boundary catchment scale
