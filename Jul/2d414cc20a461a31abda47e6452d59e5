Announcing the figures here yesterday, the Chamwino District Commissioner, Ms Vumilia Nyamoga, said only 582 out of 27,772 people were diagnosed with the infections in 2016 in the district.She pointed out that Chamwino District authorities had embarked on a special programme to impart entrepreneurship skills to people living with HIV to enable them engage in income generating activities. So far, at least 14 associations of people living with HIV have benefited from the special programme and the associations are now undertaking various projects, including poultry and dairy farming, the DC said.Ms Nyamoga added that the activities had helped to uplift the livelihoods of people living with HIV. She noted that all 27 secondary schools and 120 primary schools in Chamwino District had established student clubs to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS, urging other schools to follow suit.Meanwhile, a Dodomabased Church that operates under the auspices of Eagle Gospel Mission, has saluted President John Magufuli for spearheading the anticorruption war.Speaking here shortly after special prayers for Dr Magufuli recently, Bishop Merck Zitto noted that the zeal by the Head of State stemmed from the compelling need to save the country s natural resources from plunder by greedy people and ensure, instead, that they benefitted Tanzanians. Since his election towards the end of October 2015, President Magufuli has been at a forefront in the anti-corruption war. We should all pray to God to protect and guide him, the cleric said.The industrialisation agenda by the fifth phase government delighted him, Bishop Zitto said, because job creation would be among its major benefits.
