According to the TFF Media and Communication Officer, Alfred Lucas, the committee has also approved the federation s Technical Director, Salum Madadi to fill the post of General Secretary on the same interim basis.This decision was reached during the committee s emergency meeting in Dar es Salaam yesterday, following the recent detention of the TFF president Jamal Malinzi and his General Secretary, Mwesigwa Selestine.Malinzi and Celestine appeared before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate s Court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday facing 28 counts of fraud and money laundering of 375,418 US dollars (about 800m/-).They were arraigned jointly with an accounts officer with TFF Nsiande Mwanga. The three accused persons denied the charges before Principal Resident Magistrate Wilbard Mashauri and were remanded until tomorrow, when the court will deliver its ruling on application for bail.Malinzi, who succeeded Leodegar Tenga in October 2013, was also among the ten candidates who picked nomination forms to contest for the top post during the election scheduled for August 12th in Dodoma. The Executive Committee had an emergency meeting as per the federation s constitution sections 35 (1) and 35 (6) which allow it to come up with such decision in a situation like we are now, said Lucas.In another development, the World Football governing body, FIFA is expecting to send its delegation in the country to monitor the whole issue concerning the TFF top officials being detained in custody for various charges.On Thursday, the prosecuting team led by Senior State Attorneys Mutalemwa Kisheni, Pius Shila, Christopher Msigwa, Nassoro Gatuga and Leonard Swai disclosed that out of the charges framed against the three accused persons, Malinzi alone is facing 26 charges of forgery and money laundering.The team alleged that Selestine faces four counts of uttering false documents and money laundering and Mwanga has two money laundering counts. On June 5, last year, in the city, with intent to defraud or deceit, Malinzi and Selestine allegedly forged an Executive Committee Resolution, purporting to show that the TFF Executive Committee decided to change the signatory of the federation s bank account.Such changes, according to the prosecution, had the effect that one Edgar Leonard Masoud would be replaced by Nsiande Isawafo Mwanga.The court heard further that on September 1, 2016, at Stanbic Bank Tanzania Limited, Stanbic Centre Branch in Kinondoni District, knowingly and fraudulently, Selestine uttered the false Executive Committee Resolution.The prosecution told the court further that between November 6, 2013 and September 22, 2016, at TFF Offices in Ilala District, with intent to defraud, Malinzi forged 23 receipts bearing different numbers and money in US dollars, purporting that he had lent the federation loan of such amount, while it was false.It is alleged that between September 1 and October 19, 2016, within the city of Dar es Salaam, jointly and together, all the three accused persons conspired to commit an offence of money laundering by acquiring the said 375,418 US dollars (about 800m/-).According to the prosecution, the accused persons committed such offence while knowing that the said money was the proceeds of a predicate offence of forgery.The court was further told that within the same period at Stanbic Bank Limited, Stanbic Centre Branch within Kinondoni District, jointly and together, Malinzi and Selestine acquired the 375,418 US dollars from the bank, while knowing such acquisition of money was proceed of a crime.It was alleged also that within the same period, at TFF offices in Ilala District, Mwanga aided and abated Malinzi and Selestine to acquire the said money while at the time of acquisition she knew that the money was proceeds of predicate offence of forging the transfer of fund request form.
