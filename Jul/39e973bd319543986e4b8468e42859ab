The Abuja Declaration requires member states of the continental grouping to allocate at least 15 per cent of their annual budget for the health sector. For instance in the just ended financial year 2016/2017 Tanzania allocated US $20 dollars per person against US $13 dollars in Kenya, according to Amref Health Africa s Group Chief Executive Officer, Dr Githinji Gitahi.Dr Gitahi made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday at the Amref Health Africa annual stakeholders meeting which carried a theme; Building Healthier Communities and Partnerships. The event also marked the 60th Anniversary since the organ isation was established in 1957. The Amref Health Africa s boss was equally impressed that even as Dar es Salaam had not attained the 15 per cent target as stipulated in Abuja Declaration, the country was approaching the goal.Budget allocation for the health sector grew from 9.1 per cent in 2015/2016 to 11.3 per cent in 2016/2017. This financial year the government has allocated 1.1trl/- for health care. Not only budget allocation, Tanzania has as well made strides in other areas of health care including vaccination, infant and maternal health, among others, Dr Gitahi remarked.At the occasion, the Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ms Ummy Mwalimu, described the organisation as among key partners in improving health services. Since it opened its door in Tanzania in 1987 Amref Health Africa has been supporting government efforts in health care, Ms Mwalimu said in a speech read on her behalf by Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar s Minister for Health and Social Affairs, Mr Mahmoud Kombo.The minister praised the organisation for its landmark projects in Tanzania, one being the famous Angaza project which focuses on counseling and testing of HIV/AIDS.Minister Kombo on his part, appealed to Amref Health Africa to extend its services in Zanzibar to support that Island s government address neonatal, infant and maternal deaths, which he said were serious challenge. We recorded success in dealing with malaria, HIV, cholera and tuberculosis; the challenge we face is neonatal, infant and maternal deaths, Mr Kombo stated.The Amref Health Africa s Country Director for Tanzania, Dr Florence Temu, said during the past 60 years of operation the organisation has served over 37 million people in some African countries where it spent US $111 million dollars for health projects.
