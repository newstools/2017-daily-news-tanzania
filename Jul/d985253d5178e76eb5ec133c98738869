DC Hapi told a press conference in Dar es Salaam that his district is not a place for politicians to utter inflammatory statements against government leaders and abusing the president.He said as the Chairman of the Peace and Secu rity Committee in Kinondoni District he ordered the law enforcement officers to arrest Ms Mdee and hold her for interrogation for not less than 48 hours before further legal measures. I want police officers to arrest Halima and detain her for 48 hours so as she gives cooperation to the officers in connection with the statements that she made, he said.He emphasised that the action of Kawe s MP to say that President Magufuli has bad behaviour was against the laws of the country and according to the country s regulations Act 33, it does not allow anyone to use inflammatory words or statements against the President.He added that the arrest of Halima will be a lesson to other people who have the similar ill conduct as her for disrespecting government leaders.Meanwhile, the Acting Dar es Salaam Special Zone Police Commander, Mr Lucas Mkondya, told this paper that the process of arresting Kawe s MP is underway. We heard the DC s order and we are looking for her. We will inform you once she is arrested, said Mkondya
