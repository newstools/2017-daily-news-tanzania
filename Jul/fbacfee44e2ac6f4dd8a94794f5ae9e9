I m saying Taifa Stars failure was expected because of a variety of reasons which include, among others, their very nature of upbringing.Because of the manner with which they came to learn how to play soccer, they lack many basic soccer playing knowledge and practice that makes it difficult for them to retain, whatever they are told not to do, by their chief coach.When they were invited to take part in the southern African soccer tournament, COSAFA, a few weeks ago, both the technical bench and the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) said they were going to use the COSAFA Cup tournament as part of their preparations for the CHAN tournament.And, the one-all draw they forced over the weekend, thanks to that precious spot kick, against Amavubi is what they could show their fans as part of what they had learnt in South Africa.If Taifa Stars had learnt anything from their participation in the COSAFA Cup tournament, which saw them finishing third, then they would have known that there is nothing as bad as conceding first, and very early in the game, and when playing in your own backyard.Conceding first, very early in the game and when you re playing in your own home ground; is more often than not very tricky, as it tends to give your opponent an upper hand in the game.And, in most cases, you are not likely to win such a game and that is exactly what happened over the weekend. The first goal scored by the Rwandans and very early in the match, gave them the requisite confidence they badly needed to stop Taifa Stars from getting into their COSAFA Cup winning groove.Had Taifa Stars learnt anything from the COSAFA Cup experience, they would have known that after finishing third in the southern African regional tournament, Amavubi knew the kind of customers they were up against.And, the very knowledge that they were going to play against a team that had finished third against 12 national regional soccer teams, made the Rwandans play the match very cautiously.The technical bench has already said they have what it takes to win against Amavubi in Rwanda, I also believe they can. But they should, at least for once, try to be more professional, in their approach to the game, by doing exactly what the Amavubi did to them in Mwanza, score first and very early in the game.Having done that, they need to literally camp in their opponents half in search of winning goals, as opposed to one or two! Taifa Stars need to do what I have said because that is what the Rwandans would be planning to do, score first and as soon as possible.Taifa Stars need to score as many goals as possible because that is what is going to win them the match in case of a goal full draw. In the return leg match away from home, Taifa Stars are going to be playing against 12 players--Rwandan soccer fans.But unlike in the first leg match in Mwanza where the pressure, especially after conceding the first goal, was on Taifa Stars; in Rwanda the pressure to win would be on the Amavubi.However, Taifa Stars would have to work extremely hard for goals, because that is the only way they would be able to force their opponents to make mistakes. It was the same pressure exerted by Taifa Stars in the first match that forced Rwandan defenders to handle the ball in the penalty box.Having done so well in the COSAFA Cup tournament, I m more than convinced that Taifa Stars are very much capable of upsetting the Rwandans in their own backyard.But for that to happen, they need to behave as professionals by not only taking the game to the Rwandans, but by also tightening up their defence in the same way they had done throughout the COSAFA tournament.It is going to be a disaster if Taifa Stars fail to get past Rwanda, a team that got into the CHAN contention without getting the number of trial matches that Taifa Stars have had in less than two months.To reach the last match that gave them the third spot in the COSAFA Cup tournament, Taifa Stars played the six matches against six teams in 13 days. And after resting for three weeks, they took against Amavubi in Mwanza which was their seventh game in two month.Therefore in terms of preparation for the Chan soccer tournament, Taifa Stars were perhaps the most well prepared team.
