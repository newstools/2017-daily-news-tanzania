TBS Head of Textile and Leather Laboratory, Mr Peter Martin, said that the female condoms are being tested by using modern equipment which can detect any problem associated with the product.According to him, although the quality of male condoms started to be tested in 1990, the Bureau could not test the female condoms due to lack of equipment in its laboratory. Our organisation has succeeded in purchasing laboratory equipment for testing the quality of female condoms and the process starts with immediate effect, he said.He said that, among others, the testing is aimed at establishing whether they are suitable for human use or not and they can easily be damaged or are manufactured with pores.Mr Martin noted that since condoms are made from rubber, they can be easily damaged when exposed to light. Thus why we have a special machine for checking whether the packaging has met the required standards which will protect the condoms from direct light. He noted that when condoms are exposed to light their shelf life decreases. According to international standards, the shelf life for condoms is five years. Mr Martin, however, cautioned women to be careful when purchasing condoms to avoid using substandard products.Commenting on male condoms, Mr Martin said that in 2013 the TBS laboratory discovered the presence of substandard condoms which were destroyed. He said normally in 500,000 condoms when three are discovered to be below the required standards, the entire consignment is destroyed to protect users health and environment.
