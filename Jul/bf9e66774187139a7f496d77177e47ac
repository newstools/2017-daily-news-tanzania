We have proposed to establish a National Convention Bureau in the country in order to boost conference tourism and increase national income through foreign income because the number of international foreigners will increase, she said.She said through conference tourism it would be easy to promote other tourist attractions that are available in the country. Also it would help to increase job creation opportunities and influence investors to invest in the country.The Chairman of TTB, Justice Thomas Mihayo, said Tanzania is well known worldwide by tourism of wildlife and museums but it is not well in conference tourism through which is now becoming a famous tourism aspect worldwide through conference centres. If these foreigners come to attend meetings in our conference centres they would also get opportunity to visit our tourism attractions and increase foreign exchange, he said.
