Its Communications and Public Relations Manager, Mr Titus Kaguo, revealed yesterday at the 41st Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF) that the agency was fully prepared to ensure that all people who undertake electricity installations are registered.The move is aimed at reducing fire accidents resulting from bogus technicians fiddling with the sensitive, highly risk job, whose consequences include deaths and loss of properties. We don t allow non-professionals to undertake electricity installations, as a precaution against fatal accidents, Mr Kaguo said. Legitimate technicians are registered in grades A, B, C, D, W and S.The law requires that connecting power, repairs related to power networks should be conducted by individuals certified by EWURA. Defiance of that condition attracts a fine of 5m/- , a five- year jail term or both, he said, explaining further that issuance of practising licences was predicated on an applicant s experience and professional qualifications.Mr Kaguo said so far, the authority had licensed 1000 contractors with different grades, countrywide.
