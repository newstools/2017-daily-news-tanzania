Playing against a country that uses sports as a unifying factor to heal genocide wounds, gives an indication of a tough battle our envoys will be facing tomorrow. The Amavubi have a cause, but Tanzanians have a will and ability to advance, and therefore Taifa Stars must use all weapons in their arsenal to win the crucial tie.Isn t it strange that we have to turn our attention to CHAN now, because we have already made it to the final during the inaugural championship, hence nothing can make us fail this time.The experience Taifa Stars gain in these competitions is essential for the testing of our local players and strengthening Taifa Stars performances for qualifiers. Rwanda s Amavubi have not posed a big threat to Taifa Stars as our envoys won 2-1 in their meeting in Kenya in the last East African Challenge Cup championship.But, it s also understood that Rwanda eliminated Stars in the second edition of CHAN and qualified for the first time in the finals. Stars should therefore use this encounter to revenge or else allow their opponents to reduce them to easy preys status.Fresh from a high spirited performance in the tougher Cosafa Cup Championship, this compels Taifa Stars to use the experience and winning tactics they learned to beat Amavubi at their own venue tomorrow.Though football is unpredictable, still what Stars gained from Cosafa opponents like Malawi, Angola, South Africa, Zambia and Lesotho, can work effective against the Rwandans.To boost their performance, Taifa Stars supporters in Rwanda should turn up in numbers at Nyamirambo Stadium to cheer up the players since crowd support is proven vital in seeking victory.What we have seen from the trend that so-called famous African nations are regressing, and at the same time many other countries are improving. For this reason there isn t a big difference anymore, so Taifa Stars can be a potential big name when they beat Rwanda on their way to CHAN finals.But, as we wish our envoys all the best against the hosts Amavubi, players and the coach should work even harder against Rwanda and stop from climbing to the top using Stars as a ladder.All the best Stars, we can do it again this time because our football level has improved very much as evidenced through the recent FIFA world rankings that saw us climbing up 21 places.
