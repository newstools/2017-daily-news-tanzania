The Minister told MPs that the bank faced difficulties for few months and that the government is working hard to put things in order. She said that so far, most of the problems are over and that soon the bank will continue to offer its services as required. We underwent some troubles. We conducted a forensic audit and now things are improving. The new board is in place and TWB s new managing director is a very dynamic young man, she said.Ms Mwalimu was responding to a supplementary question from Special Seats MP (CCM) Ms Josephine Chagula who wanted to know why the government-owned TWB has branches in Dar es Salaam alone while most women are in rural areas.The MP wanted to know when TWB will open branches in various parts of the country, so as to serve women in all regions, she said. I would like to know when will TWB - which was established to serve women - open upcountry branches? she inquired.According to Ms Mwalimu, however, though TWB has only two branches in Dar es Salaam, its services are also available in 20 more regions where they are being undertaken through offices of municipal/district councils.She said after making the necessary management changes, TWB is now looking forward to receiving capital boost from the Treasury before it opens branches upcountry.Earlier, the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Dr Ashatu Kijaji advised women in rural areas to start making use of mobile phones and agent banking services if they are to get their much-needed loans.According to Dr Kijaji, the government is no longer directly involved in the setting up of financial institutions since the country embarked on reforming the financial sector in the 1990s.She said that this means that the duty of expanding financial services across the country was left to commercial banks which only open branches after conducting thorough researches on the feasibility of the same.
