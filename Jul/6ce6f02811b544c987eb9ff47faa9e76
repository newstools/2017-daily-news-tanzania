Many are likely to be surprised by my harsh comment, unfortunately that is the truth. For the naked truth is that the pedigree of the South African national soccer team cannot, in any way, be compared with that of Taifa Stars.Yes, unlike Taifa Stars, the South Africans have invested massively in their team which has not only won the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in 1996, but have also played, twice, in the Fifa World Cup finals.They first took part in the Fifa World Cup after qualifying for the tournament and in their second outing they did that as hosts in 2010 when the Fifa World Cup was held for the first time in Africa.The last time Taifa Stars played in the Afcon finals was 37 years ago in 1980 when they qualified, for the first time, in the tournament that was held in Lagos, Nigeria. In that tournament in which Taifa Stars were skippered by former TFF President, Leodgar Tenga, the Tanzanians were knocked out in the preliminaries.In short, that is the scenario Taifa Stars would be facing tomorrow when they take on the South Africans. South Africa s success in sports, and soccer in particular, has been a result of the government s deliberate policy to invest in sports from infrastructure to human resources.South African government s efforts have, for years, been strongly supported both by private business and soccer clubs. Soccer clubs support have taken the form of establishment of sound and scientifically run soccer academies.Presently over 90 per cent of South African soccer players both in amateur and professional ranks are a product of soccer academy. In fact, this explains why even the South African premier soccer league is a marvel to watch.Clubs employ different soccer formations. Unlike premier leagues in other parts of the con tinent, they don t play hit and run football. And this brings us to a very important point, namely, the type of tactical approach that Taifa Stars would have to employ against the South African team tomorrow.Because Bafana Bafana (the boys) plays a well, coordinated game, Taifa Stars need to settle down and play the kind of football they have been taught in their respective clubs and the national team.If they play in the same way they did against both Malawi and Angola, running around like headless chickens, then they are likely to go down with a heavy defeat. For Taifa Stars, possession of and employment of staying pow er would be extremely important for them tomorrow as Bafana Bafana are renowned for fast pace and endurance.And because they play a fast paced game with short, crisp, ground passes; any aimless clearance of the ball by Taifa Stars would always be thankfully collected by their opponents.It is therefore important for Taifa Stars to try as much as possible to keep the ball and move forward more intelligently. Taifa Stars are going to face a lot of problems mainly because of lack of exposure against well drilled sides.Given talent galore between and among Taifa Stars players, our boys would have by now constituted a very good side had they been exposed, constantly, to top flight matches.Indeed, we would have been talking a different language today if Taifa Stars would have had at least one, top flight friendly match every month. For instance, when Bafana Bafana won their first Afcon when they hosted the tournament in January 1996, I had lived and worked in South Africa for two years.Between the years I arrived in South Africa, in 1994 and January 1996, Bafana Bafana had played 66 friendly matches against the best teams in the world that included former Afcon and Fifa World Cup holders.That was the extent of the South African government s commitment in preparing its national soccer team when it hosted, for the first time since the unbanning of the obnoxious apartheid policy, the Afcon tournament.In fact, two days before the opening of the Afcon tournament in Johannesburg, Bafana Bafana played against the 1990 Fifa World Cup champions, Germany.And when the tournament finally kicked off, Bafana Bafana went on to win all their matches, including the final, against Tunisia in which they beat the Maghrebians side by 2-0 with all the goals coming from Mark Williams.As can be noted from the foregoing, the South Africans won the Afcon tournament in January 1996 because they had well prepared themselves for the tournament.Therefore the main difference between the South Africans and us is that we don t prepare ourselves for anything, including sports. And as they always say, if you don t prepare for something, then you re planning to fail in whatever endeavour, including that something, you re gunning for.If Taifa Stars are eliminated from the tournament tomorrow, then they would have had the opportunity of practicing for four matches against the Malawians, Angolans, Mauritians and South Africans, not a bad thing for a team that is hardly exposed to top flight friendly matches.
