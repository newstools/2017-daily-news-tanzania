The Chairman of the Tanzania Disabled Association (CHAWATA) John Mlabu said in Dar es Salaam yesterday they have requested President John Magufuli for a decree to reserve the business for people with disabilities.He said that rickshaws popular in Tanzania as Bajaj is the only employment means for people that are physically disabled, where both men and women can use it. Disabled people are discriminated in terms of employment although Persons with Disability Act no 9 of 2010 requires three percent of servants employed in various sectors being disabled people, he said.He requested the government to provide supports to the disabled people in order to import more bajaj into the country to create more jobs by waiving various taxes on rickshaws to give opportunity for the physically disabled people operate the business smoothly.He also pleaded for equal opportunities in the education sector so that more disabled people get access to the decision making machine. Many schools do not have conducive environments for physically disabled people to study which leads them not to have quality education and increase poverty among them, he added.He went on ahead saying that physically disabled people are left behind economically, politically, culturally and socially.The founder of Tanzania Association of Physically Disabled (CHAWATA) Juma Mafumo added that the physically disable are not troublesome as the way people judge them in the society but stubbornness can be termed as a person s behavior.
