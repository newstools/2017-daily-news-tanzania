The fifth phase government is currently implementing a number of projects aimed at turning Tanzania into a middle-income country by 2025. President John Magufuli said when launching the 41st DITF over the last weekend, that this year s exhibition focuses on emphasising an industrial economy through promoting trade.Retired president Mwinyi visited the grounds from around 10:45am to mid-noon accompanied by the Minister for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr Charles Mwijage. He spent about four hours touring several pavilions, including Zanzibar, National Service (JKT), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries.Speaking to journalists after the tour, Mzee Mwinyi said: The exhibition give us hopes towards an industrydriven economy. The exhibitors have confirmed that as the country we can. He said the DITF has been improving year by year and this year s event is better off than the last year.Meanwhile, Chairman of the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), Mr Reginald Mengi, said business people and local investors should stop preaching industrialisation act instead. In supporting the President on industrialisation, we don t want words, we want actions, he said at the fair grounds. He called upon companies dealing with agricultural inputs and outputs to effectively work on adding value to agricultural produce through improved technologies. The President s intention is good, but to achieve the goal, we should all support him, the agricultural sector is vital in this endeavour, Mr Mengi said.His remarks came after hearing from AGRICOM, a company that sells agricultural machinery like tractors. The management told him that it was aiming to reduce cultivation and harvesting costs to farmers by half over the next two years.
