 The fifth phase government will take harsh measures against those who will misuse cooperative funds and we will continue to make follow ups on the matter until we get leaders with integrity, the Premier said in Dodoma yesterday, during the International Co-operative Day (ICD).He said cooperatives in the country were facing a number of challenges, among them, theft and embezzlement of resources committed by some unscrupulous cooperative leaders.Premier Majaliwa (pictured) said another challenge was that some cooperative leaders disrespect the guidelines of the associations and make decisions for their personal interests.He said that in response to these challenges, the government will keep on fulfilling its obligation to put a friendly environment to promote cooperatives, in order to provide an opportunity to flourish and enable Tanzanians to own the economy of their country.ICD is an annual celebration of the co-operative movement observed on the first Saturday of July since 1923 by the International Co-operative Alliance. On December 16, 1992, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed in resolution 47/90 the first Saturday of July 1995 to be IDC, marking the centenary of the establishment of the International Cooperative Alliance.Since 1995 the United Nations International Day of Co-operatives has been observed jointly alongside International Co-operative Day. It is not acceptable at all to see this industry that portrays the life of Africans does not benefit us accordingly. I am directing the Commission for Development of Cooperatives to ensure that they are run scientifically and according to the law, he said.He also issued a directive to the Advisory Committee in regions and districts in the country, to include cooperative development as one among important agenda obliged to be discussed and come up with resolutions for implementation.Also make sure they have statistics and figures for cooperatives and its members.
