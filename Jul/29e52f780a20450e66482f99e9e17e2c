Speaking at a one-day cooperative development stakeholders meeting here yesterday, the Registrar, Mr Tito Haule tasked all cooperative managers to identify the names of officers soliciting allowances from primary cooperative societies. It is unethical for the government officers to beg for allowances from cooperative societies...this is a grave misconduct because they have already been paid duty allowances, said Mr Haule.He said assistant cooperative registrars have monthly salaries and directed them to behave professionally in helping the cooperatives to meet their objectives in the country.Mr Haule warned that anyone caught in misconduct will be summarily dismissed. Meanwhile, the Cooperative Development Commission s Legal Officer, Mr Donald Deogratias said the commission has asked the Chief Justice to allow them to have own lawyers to prosecute conflicts or cases over the cooperatives.He said many cooperative members had been inflicted in conflicts and cases before courts, against the cooperative laws because cooperative legal issues have a lot of technicalities. Mr Deogratias said that cooperative laws were silent on some matters, subjecting lawyers to difficulties. Many advocates lack cooperative law experience to the extent they fumble in the cases, so I appeal for the use of our own lawyers from the cooperative development commission who have experience of cooperative laws as well as cooperative conflict issues, argued Mr Deogratias.
