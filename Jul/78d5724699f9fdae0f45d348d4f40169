Yesterday, property tax payers were witnessed in large numbers at TRA offices after they were informed that it was the last day of the exercise.Speaking to the Daily News on Saturday over the phone yesterday, TRA Director for Taxpayer Services and Education, Mr Richard Kayombo, said the extension aimed at providing more time for those who did not complete the exercise to do so. It is true that we decided to extend time for the exercise to July 15, this year, to give chance to those who did not get time to pay their taxes to do so and after the expiry of the new date penalties will be included, said Mr Kayombo.He, however, reminded citizens that 2017/2018 financial year which start on July 1, has begun and therefore they must start paying their property taxes earlier instead of waiting for D-days . People should start paying their taxes earlier instead of waiting until the final days. We have almost 365 days ahead to the coming financial year, we are hoping this time people will pay their property taxes on time, he said.He added: We expect those who are yet to pay property taxes for the financial year 2016/2017 will use this time to do so, because from July 15 those who failed to do so will face legal actions and fines.
