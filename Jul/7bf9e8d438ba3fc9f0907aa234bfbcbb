A medical source told the Daily News here yesterday that the isolation centre at Chumbuni in Urban West region, had only one cholera patient.The Director for Preventive Services and Health Education in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dr Fadhili Mohamed, said there was no new case reported in all four isolation centres of Chumbuni, Gamba (North Unguja), Makunduchi and Bambi (South Unguja), with dozens of cholera patients who were admitted at the centres during the past few weeks having been discharged.Over 300 suspected cases have been registered since the latest cholera outbreak in March, this year, with four deaths recorded, but the fatality rate has dropped to zero, thanks to a number of interventions, said Dr Mohamed.He attributed the fall to emergency intervention by the ministry of health and other key stakeholders, including increased public awareness on cholera-prevention measures, water treatment and increased supply of clean and safe water. We have also controlled the sale of fresh foods and sensitised members of the public on the importance of adhering to anti-cholera measures, he said, reminding food vendors to observe the regulations which prohibit the sale of food at the congested areas.
