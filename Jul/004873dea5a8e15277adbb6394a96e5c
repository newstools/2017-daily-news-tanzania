The semi-autonomous Island gained full membership to the African football governing body CAF in March, this year, after a protracted pursuit, which seemingly cleared the path for the Island, part of the United Republic of Tanzania, to be recognized by FIFA. After Zanzibar obtained full CAF membership, it makes a great possibility of securing FIFA membership, which will enable our youth take part in international competitions. Our task now is to prepare our boys to compete efficiently in international competitions and bring honour to our nation, Amb. Iddi said recently.Nonetheless, the bid for FIFA membership apparently faces one big challenge of being regarded as part of Tanzania and therefore not eligible for membership under the governing body s current statutes, which stipulates that member should be an independent country.The Indian Ocean Island had its previous application rejected by Fifa in 2005, but the new development has revived the quest more international recognition and Islander are more convinced than ever of as achieving yet another landmark in the world football.Zanzibar s campaign for recognition in the international football community has always been supported by the Union government and pursuit for Fifa membership is being currently spearheaded by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF).The archipelago was previously an associate member on the continent, allowing its clubs to play in CAF competitions, but its national team was excluded. But the decision to award it with full membership in March will allow Zanzibar Heroes to participate in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying.Should Zanzibar s bid for Fifa membership excel, then the Island will become the 212th member association of world football s governing body.Earlier this week, President Ali Mohamed Shein said his government is committed to developing sports from the grassroots level, revealing the implementation of a newly-launched Sport 55 programme is geared at achieving that goal.Dr Shein said the government has raised a total of 300m/- for the implementation of the Sport 55 programme, which seeks to promote sports participation among students.President Shein added that as part of the programme, a sport ground will be constructed in each district, noting that two grounds are already being constructed in phase one which will see five districts availed with a modern playing ground.
