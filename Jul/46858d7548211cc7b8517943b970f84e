Its associates include Mkuki Na Nyota Publishers, the British Council and ANZA, East Africa s first architecture and urban planning magazine.DARCH Director, Ms Aida Mulokozi, said the building was among the oldest modern standing building aged 160 years. Together with Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC), we have successful turned the historic building into a public centre celebrating Dar s urban heritage and history as well as promote it to tourists and general public, she said during the grand ceremony.Ms Mulokozi further said heritage preservation should not be misunderstood rather supported as it was among the key driver of economic and social development.Head of the EU Delegation to Tanzania, Ambassador Roeland van de Geer, said he was pleased to finally see DARCH launched as it was a long and intensive process conducted for three years. If we don t preserve the past that means there is no future, as the city transforms it is cordially important to preserve and renovate oldest building instead of demolishing them as they are the symbol of the real Dar es Salaam city, he noted.
