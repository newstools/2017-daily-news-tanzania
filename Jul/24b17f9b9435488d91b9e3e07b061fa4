Dr Ackson was responding to speaker s guidance that was asked by Moshi Urban MP (Chadema), Mr Jaffari Michael who wanted to get government clarification on the arrest of traders and seizing of food that is circulated within Kilimanjaro Region and in particular Rombo District, which borders with Kenya.The MP said traders have been complaining that the government security organs have been seizing food from traders who intend to sell it in Rombo District. I would like to inform the government that trucks that carry food to Rombo District have been seized by security organs, he said.The MP added that the situation is challenging since traders who always sell food in Rombo and other areas along the border cannot proceed with their business and that residents of those areas are being denied the right to buy food within their country.According to Mr Michael, security organs impound trucks on the grounds that the food is being exported to neighbouring countries. Last week, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa banned the exportation of food.However, some officials have been impounding trucks that transport food to Rombo District, he said. The MP asked the government to state categorically that the Premier s directives aimed at banning exportation of food crops to neighbouring countries and not selling food within the country. I would like to ask the government to clarify the ban because some traders are not al lowed to transport food to areas that are located along the borders, he said. The Deputy Speaker asked government officials to stop seizing trucks and food until they are satisfied by explanations from traders. I think there is a big challenge here, but at the same time I do not think the officials can just seize a truck without getting enough information on the matter, she said.Dr Ackson added that traders must always be transparent and give clear information on where they are taking the food to avoid misunderstandings between them and government officials.
