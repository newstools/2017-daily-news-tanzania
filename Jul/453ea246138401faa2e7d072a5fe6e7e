Dr Magufuli told the Board of Directors of TanTrade that they should think of setting up an industry which could serve as an example to other investors, instead of injecting funds into construction of new buildings. As an entity under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, I think it will be good for you to show by example as we are pushing the industrialisation agenda rather than only encouraging others to do, he said.He directed the board and management of TanTrade to leave the responsibility of constructing new buildings to exhibitors themselves and sign agreements with them on how to recover their money. They can construct and leave them use the buildings for free for a particular period. In fact, by doing this you will be retaining them to partici pate in the annual trade fair, he said.His remarks came after the Chairman of the board, Eng Christopher Chiza, stated that they were planning to modernise the Grounds by constructing modern pavilions and hotel to accommodate foreign exhibitors who have been forced to seek shelter far from the trade fair grounds. Currently, exhibitors have to travel long distances to places where they sleep but with the planned hotel they will be sleeping here and depart to the airport which is not far from here, Eng Chiza explained.But Dr Magufuli opposed, saying having the hotel may not guarantee getting the exhibitors sleeping in there, but they may still seek hotels of their choice in town. The chairman and your board need to revisit your plan.I have appointed you just recently and if these are you plans you make me think of my appointment, he said amid laughter from the gathering during the official opening of the 41st Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF).In a quick rejoinder, EngChiza agreed with the President s directive and promised to work on it while asking him not to rethink over appointing him.Meanwhile, President Magufuli told the TanTrade to consider extending time for this year s trade fair which was planned to end on 8th of July so that citizens can have an opportunity to continue doing business at the grounds.He said he was impressed by the response by wananchi and the companies participating at this year s trade fair. At least 515 foreign companies from 30 countries and 2,500 local companies are participating in the event.Speaking over benefits of the trade fair, Dr Magufuli said it gives the companies opportunity to meet with their customers and get first-hand feed back over their products for improvement.
