This warning came from the Athletics Tanzania (AT) president, Anthony Mtaka at an occasion to present the national flag to the team in Arusha yesterday, ready for the forthcoming 42nd edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships to be held on Sunday.Mtaka said all athletes and their coaches must be careful with what they consume, saying it was important to keep away from substances related to performance enhancing drugs because any slight mistake will tarnish the country s image. Athletes, coaches and leaders in the entourage must be keen to make sure that the country s integrity is maintained by shunning un-sportsmanship behaviours. Go and fight for medals and that will bring honours for our country, he said.He said the team has been undergoing an intensive training for the past few weeks, saying that the AT is confident the athletes will post good results. We thank the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) for supporting our team, we believe this will encourage the athletes to perform well and in the process promote the country s tourist attractions across the borders. We also thank the Ministry of Defence through the National Service, for affording us with a bus that will take our athletes to Kampala, Mtaka said.TANAPA Acting Director, Nyamakumbati Mafuru also encouraged the athletes to aim high at the event by winning medals. The national team, which is being kitted out to participate in the event is a 50 by 50 gender balanced entourage, featuring 14 women in the fold of 28 athletes.And, all the sportsmen and women have confidently promised to make the country proud once it arrives in Uganda for the Sunday event. For the first time, in 26 years, AT has dispatched the largest athletic team to participate in an International sporting event.AT Secretary General Wilhelm Gidabuday said that the last time the country sent such a large athletics team was back in 1991, for the Belgian event, when Tanzania sent 24 athletes.Organisers of the race unveiled over 600m/- prize cash to the winners.
