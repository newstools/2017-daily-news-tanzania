Simon Msuva s first half strike gave Stars the lead, but striker Laudit Mavugo cancelled it out in the second stanza but Yusuf came off the bench to grab a winner in his debut for Taifa Stars colours.The victory came as a sweet revenge against Burundi, who beat Stars 3-0 in their last friendly outing.The win also continued to mark perfect start for Stars new head coach Salum Mayanga, whose mission is to prepare his charges for their upcoming 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers and the 2018 Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) qualifiers.Mayanga made several changes in the squad that started in a 2-0 win over Botswana s Zebras in another friendly encounter at the same venue last Saturday.He dropped skipper Mbwana Samatta, first choice goalkeeper Aishi Manula, Erasto Nyoni and Frank Domayo. Instead, Deogratius Munishi started between the posts, while Salim Mbonde came in the central defensive line to partner Abdi Banda, while Salum Aboubakar and Mzamiru Yasin were deployed to support assistant captain, Himid Mao in the pack of the midfield.Ajib and Tenerife attacker, Farid Mussa were trusted to start in the attacking line and they put up a wonderful performance.However, it was a bit scrappy start for both sides but Taifa Stars slightly picked up and just four minutes into the play, Ajib latched onto a drop ball, drew rings around defenders before setting up Msuva but his shot was clutched metres away by goalkeeper, Jonathan Nahimana. Ajib s follow-up shot was also cleared off the line.After several near misses, Msuva put Stars ahead with a bullet shot in the 20th minute, volleying home from Ajib s flicked header, following Mohamed Hussein s well measured cross into the box.Despite conceding a goal, Burundi were seeing plenty of balls and Mavugo was a constant threat with power and precisions. Mavugo s powerful shot from a set piece narrowly missed the target in the 31st minute.After the break, Stars started impressively, creating several scoring chances and in the 50th minute, Hussein cleverly manoeuvred past defenders towards the box but his diagonal cross found no one in the box.A minute later, Ajib set up Msuva but his shot missed the target. Burundi called in C dric Dany Urasenga for Youssouf Ndayishimiye, changes which gave the visitors much impetus. Stars were then punished for their ineptness in the 53rd minute, when Mavugo netted an equaliser after beating Banda to the ball.The defender attempted to control a deep cross inside the box but missed the ball, allowing Mavugo to race clear and scored. After the goal, coach Mayanga introduced Said Ndemla for Salum Aboubakar in the 57th minute and Stars stepped up the gear in search for a winner.The home side wasted a chance to go ahead in the 64th minute when they were awarded foul six yards out after Burundi goalkeeper handed the back pass. However, Ajib s shot was blocked.The match winner Mbaraka Yusuf came in for Farid Musa in the 65th minute and it took him 12 minutes to register his first goal in his debut for Stars. He calmly finished off from Msuva s pass. His initial shot came off the bar but finished it off with a follow-up attempt.Stars made two more changes with Simba skipper Jonas Mkude coming in for Mzamiru and Shiza Kichuya replaced limping Ajib. Stars will be expecting an improvement in the next FIFA world ranking after their win against Botswana and Burundi both of who were ahead of them in the ranking.
