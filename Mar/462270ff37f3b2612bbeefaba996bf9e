Those expelled from the party are four regional chairpersons, five district chairpersons and three members of the top decision-making NEC. Another six members were stripped of their titles, four given a warning and one forgiven after a stiff investigation found him without blemish. The party’s Ideology and Publicity Secretary, Mr Humphrey Pole Pole, told journalists after the NEC meeting that these hard decisions were reached following protracted meetings by party bodies charged with discipline – among other duties – had satisfied themselves with investigative reports on the individual members. However, we would strongly caution our readers against putting a premium on names or faces of the people that the party has dismissed from its ranks; to start with, it wasn’t on account of people’s names or faces – it was purely on account of performance and accountability to the electorate – the votes from those simple CCM members – which propelled them into national prominence. There’s something crucial here: The party is currently reorganizing, so as to strengthen, its position to serve the people better from the grassroots to the top echelons. In that process, there are bound to be some ‘misfits’ or people who have read the intentions of the current leadership entirely on their own interpretation of things; the way “we used to run the party” as it were. Well, those were old times. The way to run things now seems to have found many of us out of kilter; the party cannot, for example, continue crowding one of its decision-making committees with more than 300 members, for instance, when all it needs is half that number to do the same things much more efficiently. Yet these are the very things that kept the party overburdened just because we needed to accommodate someone for sake of their names. There is a saying: “Every moment is beautiful; delicious even!” For the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), that moment is now.
