Plans are also underway to establish an Industrial Development Bank that would deal with matters related with the sector including provision of low-interest loans and capital to support the fifth phase government agenda of industrialization.The Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (MITI) in charge of Industry, Dr Adelhelm Meru, disclosed this in Dar es Salaam over the weekend while officiating at a one-day workshop to evaluation implementation of the 2003 SME development policy.Dr Meru said it was time the policy was now reviewed to accommodate new changes, adding that the move would seek to facilitate a smooth shift to the envisaged middle income by 2025.He explained further that the SMEs were made up of almost 98 per cent local industries, and that the sector would facilitate creation of more employment opportunities. Most of Tanzanian youth and business people who wish to open up small industries fail to do so for lack of capital investment, and many cannot afford the high loans interest rates currently charged by the country s commercial banks.TIB alone cannot provide low-interest loans to all the SMEs, he said, calling on other sectors to support the country s economic effort. However, Dr Meru also called for improved infrastructure development in areas allocated to investors in order to attract yet more investments.The PS also underlined the importance of technology as the most important part in industrialization and that the government was keen on strengthening scientific research centers and other organizations charged with development of small industries."We need to remove barriers in doing business, including unnecessary taxes and charges since many institutions have been going after one investor for various collections. We need to improve ease of doing business by eliminating some taxes that discourage investors, Dr Meru stressed.The ministry s Assistant Director, Department of industry and small businesses, Boniface Michael, said the review had come at the right time when the government was committing resources to improve the industrial sector. Normally the policy needs to be reviewed at least every five years. But we haven t done it since 2003 due to shortage of funds, he explained, adding the policy needs to take on other sectors such as oil and gas.
