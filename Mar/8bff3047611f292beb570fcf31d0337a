Zinga Pharmaceutical Industry whose construction is scheduled to take 18 months, subject to fund release, will produce Antiretroviral drugs, Anti-Malaria, Anti-Hypertension and non-penicillin antibiotics, among others.Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Minister Ummy Mwalimu told a stakeholders meeting here yesterday that establishment of the pharmaceutical factory will guarantee drug availability and improve health services in the country. I commend the promoters of Zinga pharmaceutical company for coming up with this idea... as the minister responsible with the health sector, I am indeed happy for the project, especially after hearing that ARVs and anti-Malaria drugs will be among the products produced, said the minister in a speech read on her behalf by acting Government Pharmacist Hosiana Mapunjo.The minister described the envisaged factory as good news as HIV and Malaria are the leading killer diseases in the country.Construction of the pharmaceutical factory is expected to cost 70bn/- and use high German technology to produce drugs of international standards.She particularly commended the Unit Trust of Tanzania (UTT) for assisting in securing a loan for the project, imploring other financiers to invest in pharmaceutical production.Tanzania currently has 13 pharmaceutical industries whose total production capacity cover a mere 20 per cent of the country demand, with the government spending over 100 million US dollars (over 200bn/-) annually to import drugs. It s estimated that by 2021 the government will be spending 350 million (about 800bn/-) annually on drug imports, said Ms Mwalimu. Zinga Pharmaceutical Ltd founding member, Dr Mary Mayige said the first phase of the project; the feasibility study has been completed and submitted to the prospective funder.Dr Mayige whose speciality is on diabetes, said complaints of shortage and fake drugs were among the factors that catalysed the establishment of the industry, which occupies 17,000 square metres in Bagamoyo s Zinga area.Dr Mayige said the envisaged pharmaceutical factory s production capacity is 970 mwillion tablets and 120 million ARVs per year. We will produce quality products that will not only reduce and control shortage but also check counterfeit drugs in the domestic market, noted Dr Mayige.
