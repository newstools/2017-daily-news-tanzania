Among its diplomatic forays, the country is now out to woo investors from Tanzania to go and invest in its finance, agriculture, hospitality and industry sectors as well as in marine services.Addressing journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Somaliland Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Dr Saad Shire, said the country has all the credentials that a sovereign state is entitled to have. Somaliland has its own elected government, an army, its own currency and a flag we therefore deserve recognition we believe that we have a legal case, a humanitarian case and, above all, a history now, Dr Shire pointed out. He said initially such traits had denied his country international recognition it deserves, adding : To the extent of denying us basic rights such as access to international credit, loans, aid and migration to other countries. He further said: Politics and misconceptions are major issues that have hindered our country from gaining its full recognition as a sovereign state in the past .. people do not understand the full history between Somalia and Somaliland. Dr Shire hinted that their separation from Somalia had occurred a very long time ago, therefore, it should not hinder them from acquiring what was rightfully theirs. Somaliland is not at war with Somalia, but if it happens, we are ready to defend our country at anytime we also believe that once we become a sovereign state, Somalia will also benefit, he argued.
