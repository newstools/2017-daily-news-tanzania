The Committee also directed the Ministry of Water and Irrigation to submit in writing, a list of the Ministry officials names who failed to be accountable in their duties and led to the shortfalls identified by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG), adding that stern measures must be taken against them.The Ministry s performance report indicated that eight projects out of nine which were audited had additional costs of between 10 to 229 percent, which is contrary to the costs displayed in the contracts.Speaking during the meeting with the Ministry officials, here yesterday, the Committee Chairperson, Ms Naghenjwa Kaboyoka, said that her committee was disappointed with the Ministry s performance, adding that it failed to show any tangible evidence on actions taken to address the shortfalls. The CAG recommended in the report that the money which was lost due to negligence should be paid back, but so far nothing has been collected, she pointed out.According to the CAG report, changing the direction of water pipes, extended time, use of plastic pipes instead of the steel one, and interest rates due to delays in paying contractors as well as changes in the costs of the projects were questionable allegations to have authorised the officials to inflate the costs. We are giving you the last warning; it seems that there is laxity in the Ministry because it is almost one year since the CAG issued the report and no action has been taken so far, the chairperson stressed.She cautioned that her committee will recommend further actions if it will not be convinced again with the ministry report.
