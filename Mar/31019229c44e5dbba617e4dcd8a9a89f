Roaring into its fourth since launching its showdown, on March, the race for the maximum points has become unbearably tough.This indicates that this year s league is very tough hence requires extra skills to secure maximum points once a team seeks to secure a place in the play off.There were three matches in the league organised by the Dar es Salaam Regional Volleyball Association (DAREVA).The first match saw CDS Park recording their first victory after defeating Mjimwema by 3-2 sets in a closely contested match.It was a sweet victory for CDS Park, one of the teams making appearance to this year league. They won the points after losing back to back matches in recent weeks.According to league rules if a team win 3-2, the loser is award ed a point while two points go to winners. For the team to win all three points must have won either by 3-0 or 3-1 sets.In another exciting match held at the same venue on Sunday, Chui rallied to beat Police Marine by 3-2 sets in a closely fought encounter.But Kinyerezi, also making maiden appearance failed to match iP Sports challenge after losing by 3-1 sets. DAREVA technical committee Chairman, Nasoro Sharifu, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the league that used to be played every weekend will from next week also be played on Mondays and Wednesdays.He said they were forced to reschedule the fixture so as to have a room for the postponed matches that involved teams from military institutions.The teams, according to Shariff, include Jeshi Stars, Tanzania Prisons and JKT both men s and ladies. DAREVA Volleyball League will be played in two phases and the best four teams from each group will qualify for the play- off stage.
