It has been found that poor management, lack of focus and lack of effective financial sponsorship have contributed much to the retardation of sports in the country, now seeking to regain its past sporting glory.While most of that sports that Tanzanians excelled during the state monopoly are slowly showing signs of regaining life, several private firms are now on increase to support the revival of sports, with football being the most favoured.At the moment local sports-oriented companies like Azam are trying to spread tentacles to all corners of the country and even trying to reach a regional market. Vodacom Tanzania as the league title sponsor, the premier league has also managed to lure other firms too, most notably Tanzania Breweries Limited, NMB, Azam, Cowbell, Kagera Sugar or Mtibwa.From what private firms and individuals offered as supports to the football teams, the football fraternity has fully realised that the progress of sports in the country should not be left to the state alone since individuals and private firms have also a role to play in it.Financial institutions such as banks have also played a vital role in developing sports as sponsors recently Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Tanzania Limited was the force to reckon with in what it introduced in East Africa as Road to Anfield football promotion.
