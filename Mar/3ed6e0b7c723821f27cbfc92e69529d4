The ticket to play in the final has initiated a campaign to support and boost the team s preparations, and the campaign is now sweeping across the country.This campaign received another boost this week when the newly appointed Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe called upon Tanzanians to rally behind the team by raising funds to help the team foot preparation costs.In his conference with the government information officers in Dodoma, the minister said if one Tanzanian donates 200/-, it will raise 1bn/- set aside as budget to foot the team s preparation and participation to the continent s biggest youth finals.The money is needed to enable the team pitch a monthlong camp abroad so that the players can go to Gabon welldrilled and able to overcome threats of tough opponents. We are sure that well-trained and tactically superior team wins, hence facilitating the success of the team means helping the country to rid itself of underdog status.It is a double mission in Gabon as Tanzania, placed on Group B alongside Niger and Angola, must win in the group to qualify for the U-17 World Cup finals to be held in India this October. Nobody is going to help us achieve our goal, hence we are the ones obliged to join hands to support our boys technically, financially and morally until we reach the desired end.Though we face too many challenges at the Serengeti Boys camp, history has shown that our patriotic boys perform better regardless of the kind of obstacles they may be facing as challenges. All the boys need to do is to be at ease, be free and focus on their own training while the rest do all what can be done to ensure everything goes smoothly.It is everyone s responsibility, because individuals, private and government institutions can join hands to help the team garner what every Tanzanian desires as the ultimate goal.
