Mr Bendera told a village gathering at Kiru over the weekend that the land he received from the investor would soon be parceled out equally and fairly among local residents.The RC told the residents that the generous offer would help reduce land-related conflicts between local villagers and investors as well as between farmers and livestock keepers, saying more space would now be made available to all parties. All people must be patient here the land and plot allocations may not start immediately and during this time we do not want to hear cases of people invading or trespassing into other people s areas to cause trouble, warned Mr Bendera.Hamiri Estate currently operates two pieces of land in Babati District, including its largest, Unit 18 with 2,390 acres, which has now been given back to local residents and Unit 181 with 613 acres which remains under possession of the Estate. The investor still holds the 99-year lease of (both) the farms and now we are going to revoke the title deed for the Unit 18 Estate in order to revert the land ownership to local villagers, the RC elaborated.Kiru village which sits next to the farms will be the first to benefit from the new land allocation; the neighbours have always remained steeped in conflict -- all related to farms, land and related resources.
