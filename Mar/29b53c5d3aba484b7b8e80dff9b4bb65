The Tanzanians, Yanga play Zambian side Zanaco in the first round of CAF Champions League first leg match at the National Stadium, knowing a win by a big margin will give them a downhill task in the away return leg match in Zambia.The win is very crucial for the Tanzanian envoys, since it will land them into the Group Stage of the tournament. Like Yanga, Azam, who host Mbabane Swallows, qualified into the CAF Confederation Cup through a Federation Cup ticket.Zanaco, the Zambian League champions who are based in Lusaka, should not be underrated as they are among the most successful and decorated clubs in Zambian football history. Over the years the Sunset Stadium-based team has won 7 Super League trophies, 4 Charity Shields, 1 Coca-Cola Cup, 1 Mosi Cup and 3 BP Cups. Though little known in Tanzania, Azam too should not underrate their Swazi opponents. Mbabane Swallows boast a number of international players, most notably Nigerian Daniel and Ghanaians Mike Mohamed and Christian Kassim.Should they clear the Mbabane Swallows hurdle, the icecream makers will proceed into the second round of the tournament to be played on April 7or 8, and its return on April 14, 15 or 16. From this fact, good results can be obtained through a team work approach involving goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and goal scorers.We therefore urge players, especially strikers, to be more ruthless in front of goal if they are to keep their Group Stage qualification dream alive. In most of their past matches, our two envoys have been missing many scoring opportunities, which if converted could have completely changed their status in the continental level events.It s a tough campaign to qualify for the upper stages, hence in a simple language, scoring many goals while conceding less or none must be our teams ultimate objective. We all wish our flag bearers all the best in their tough mission, knowing very well that their success will also benefit their success-hungry country.
