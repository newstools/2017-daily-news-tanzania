The Tanzanian envoys are pitted against Mouloudia Club d Alger of Algeria in the Second round of CAF Confederation Cup, with the first match to be held in Dar es Salaam in the first weekend of April and a return leg a week later in Algerian capital, Algiers.The club s Secretary General, Charles Boniface Mkwasa told The Daily News that they are putting their strength on the April 1 league game which he said vital in their title defence campaign.He urged fans to stop worrying about their Algerian opponents Mouloudia Club D Alger who they would meet a week later in the Confederation Cup Play-off.Yanga, who are the league s defending champions, are currently second-placed in the league table with two points adrift behind the leaders Simba with 55 points.According to Mkwasa the team s focus is to defend their title after they were eliminated from the CAF Champions League and demoted to the Confederation Cup.He said the clash with Azam is vital since will play a big role in the team s title defence campaign. We have two or three weeks to prepare for the Confederation Cup Play-offs, so we have decided to put much weight on Azam, hoping also to use the match to drill players for MC Alger clash, he said.However, Mkwasa was earlier quoted in an interview with city s FM radio station saying that they were aware of that they were pitted against a North African team, but this time around, he warned, they were going to overcome the North African threat.Mkwasa also rubbished rumours that their April 7 first leg play-off match of the Confederation will be held on April 7 at CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza. We are yet to decide on the venue or a date of the match against Algerians, and as I have mentioned earlier will focus on the Confederation Cup after finishing our business with Azam on April 1, he explained.Yanga have remained the representatives in the continental level tournament after other three teams; Azam FC, Zanzibar s KVZ and Zimamoto being eliminated from both the CAF Confederation Cup and Champions League respectively.
