Brazilian Ambassador to Tanzania, Carlos Alfonso Iglesias Puente, told the 'Daily News' in an exclusive interview that the debt rescheduling was being worked out by Brazil and Tanzania through the ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs.He said that the remaining amount would be paid in two installments of 14.7 million US dollars each (32.3bn/-) , probably by July this year after agreement was signed by representatives of both sides.The move, opens up trading and financing opportunities by major Brazilian Financial Institutions such as Brazilian Development Bank, something which could not be before the rescheduling of the debt."The move will not only cement the existing good relations between our countries but also boost the Tanzania economy by facilitating the presence of Brazilian institutions financing various development programmes and projects here," he said.Ambassador Puente, who is marking one year since he assumed diplomatic office in Dar es Salaam, said Brazil was already engaged in talks to support cotton production in Eastern African countries of Kenya, Burundi and Tanzania.He said the first round of talks for the project to cost 6 million US Dollars (13bn/-) and span around four years were held in Dar es Salaam last December and second round of talks will be held in Nairobi, Kenya soon.He said the support, which is unconditional and with no commercial ties, seeks to improve the quantity and especially the quality of cotton produced with the view to meet set international standards, attract international markets and subsequently feed the local markets and realising the dream of seeing Tanzania of industrialised economy.In Tanzania, the project will be implemented in Mwanza region and already soil samples and infrastructure to support it, including waste water management was being worked on. The project is being financed by Brazil under South- South arrangement.The ambassador appreciated the government move to send a new Tanzanian envoy to Brazil, saying this will help in efforts to not only cement relationship but also promote trade between the two countries and reach a point of winwin relationship of the two countries.He cited the area of tourism where he said some Brazilians and other foreigners visited Tanzania after passing through other destinations something which would have benefited the country more if they had come direct.He said Tanzania and Brazil could explore trade arrangements to increase bilateral trade, which reached its peak in 2012 and is currently under its potential. On sugarcane production, the ambassador said having in place conducive environment such as land, friendly tax regimes and labour training could attract Brazilian firms to venture into this business but said he has already presented an idea to explore the possibilities in sugar and ethanol production.Another area for possible cooperation, he mentioned, was training of Tanzanian diplomats in the Brazilian Diplomatic Academy, which is one of the best such schools in Latin America, implementing an existing agreement between both countries
