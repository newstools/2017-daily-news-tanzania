Speaking to Kawowo Sports after the Uganda Cranes 3-0 victory against the Eastern region select side, Micho was impressed with the SC Villa striker, a player he had failed to summon months ago.The on form forward was among the three different scorers for the national team in the wellattended match. Nelson Senkatuka broke the deadlock with a 10th minute strike before Martin Kizza doubled the lead 12 minutes later.The day s skipper curled home a great freekick past a largely unimpressive goalie Hannington Ssebwalunyo for the third strike before the Ndejje University shot stopper was pulled out for Artland Katale Kamuli Park s Aziz Omonyi.Micho picked six players that he will use for this week s two matches (against Kenya and French Military team) but only Okwi made the team for the Kenyan game.The Cranes play Kenya on Thursday away in Nairobi before hosting the French Militants at Nelson Mandela National Stadium.
