It was an opportunity from which he was reminded how much of an international language music is. Such moments, when artists can join forces without any prior preparation and produce something acceptable for themselves and an audience, are rare here, between us artists. Many artists here tend to be less interested or prepared to share a stage, Mad Ice told the Daily News when asked what he got from the short collaboration on Monday evening.The fact that the then visiting Popo, who had come to officially open the Francophone Week, with seven other musicians here in Dar es Salaam, is a more established internationally renowned artist, is more reason, why Mad Ice will cherish the moment and teachings he got from their short collaboration.On his part, Popo told the Daily News he had allowed Mad Ice to join them on stage, simple because of the joy and learning he gets from sharing.For him there s nothing better than meeting another musician in such an impromptu situation. That he says feels good just because of the sharing.He praised the local boy for having an amazing voice and warm personality. Afterall, That s how music gets to be creative, when collaborat ing with others, Popo suggested.Music, he maintains is for building people and influence them to do good things. Added to this it s meant to please them, cure diseases and bad spirits. Once somebody is in a good mood, they do good things. It s very hard for somebody to be feeling at peace with themselves and then do bad things. The world is suffering from people, who just want to take.They have forgotten the original value of human beings, as being sharing. Music must bring this thing back to people. I don t want to sound too corny or pretentious but that s why I play music, he resolved.The sharing of human values, Popo said become a vivid reality when he gets the opportunity to collaborate with other musicians, as was the case with Mad Ice on Monday.
