The legislators, however, cautioned that, should the government fail to meet the company s budget needs, it will continue operating inefficiently.Presenting the STAMICO report on the implementation of the 2016/2017 budget to members of the Parliamentary Committee on Energy and Minerals here yesterday, the firm s acting Managing Director, Mr Hamisi Komba, said the company expected to collect revenues totaling over 24bn/-.He said that the revenue included 6,634,402,000/- from the government, 3,076,713,150 from internal sources, 4,083,902,000/- from development partners and 10,445,397,000/- as loans. For the period between July 2016 and March 2017, the company collected only 6,193,640,868/- which is equivalent to 25.6 per cent of the estimated budget, Mr Komba said.The report indicated that the mining firm is involved in a number of projects, including operating Stamigold mine, Buckreef gold project, Tanzanite One partnership, Buhemba Gold Mine project, Kiwira coal project and Iron ore project among others.Contributing, Karagwe MP, Innocent Bashingwa (CCM) proposed for reorganization of the company to increase efficiency.He said the company should not be dissolved because the main objective for its establishment remains valid and instead it should be empowered and focused on areas which are beneficial to the nation. He faulted the company s strategic plan, saying it has highly contributed to its poor performance.Another committee member, Daimu Mpakate (Tunduru- South, CCM) said the government should allocate sufficient funds to facilitate execution of development projects. It will be difficult to evaluate the performance of the mining firm if it will not be provided with sufficient funds to carry out its activities, Mr Mpakate noted.Bukoba Urban legislator, Wilfred Lwakatare (Chadema) advised the Parliament to approve the budget for few projects, which can be implemented instead of having many but without implementation.The Committee s Chairman Dotto Biteko expressed his dissatisfaction over the firm s performance, challenging the management to operate innovatively for survival. Members of Parliament have been proposing dissolution of this company if your performance will not change one day we will let the company be disbanded, Mr Biteko noted.
