The funds channelled through Vodacom Tanzania Foundation supports an initiative dubbed Moyo project which has benefited over 6,000 women in Sengerema and Shinyanga districts, according to a statement issued yesterday.The project supports maternal health following deaths and complications during delivery amongst pregnant women especially in the two districts. It entailed rushing pregnant women to health care facilities for delivery using ambulance taxis which were paid for by Vodacom Tanzania Foundation through M-Pesa, the statement said.Through the project 500 community health workers in the two regions were capacitated to give proper health care to pregnant women after receiving training.In the same light of saving lives of infants and pregnant women, Vodacom Tanzania Foundation in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and other stakeholders invested in a health education programme that allowed pregnant women and new mothers to acquire information about prenatal and postnatal care through text messages free of charge.Statistics show that as of late last year, about 500,000 beneficiaries which accounted for half of the total number of beneficiaries of the programme were Vodacom customers. We embarked on supporting maternal health to complement government s efforts as per the SDGs, and we also believe that this is a very important course that needed much support in order to reduce unnecessary maternal deaths and morbidity, the Director of Vodacom Tanzania Corporate Affairs &amp; PR, Rosalynn Mworia, said.Vodacom Tanzania Foundation in collaboration with implementing partners including CCBRT invested in cervical cancer and fistula treatments for women in upcountry regions like Mwanza, Mbeya and Iringa.Through the programme, Vodacom Tanzania Foundation dished out 183m/- to cover transportation (bus fares) for women with cervical cancer or fistula to travel to the Dar es Salaam based CCBRT for treatments. Hundreds of women from these regions have benefited from this programme, we have received many testimonial stories from them, thanking us for facilitating their transportation to the treatment centre and back to their homes after treatments, she said.
