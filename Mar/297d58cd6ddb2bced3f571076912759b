I was shocked seeing how the driver lost control of his vehicle which then rammed a motorcycle (bodaboda) from behind then skidded over the minors to death as they were crossing the road then it roughly hit the edge of the road before it veered off the road and rolled-over two times, she narrated.Another eyewitness, Mr Festus Kapufi a resident of Kibolye area of Mtimbwa Village said that Aidan Sepe was hit first, dying on the spot. The other victim, Oliveta died on the way to Rukwa Regional Referral Hospital in Sumbawanga Town the motorcycle rider escaped unharmed we could not write down the registration numbers of his bodaboda due to shock, added Mr Kapufi.Kibolye area chairman, Mr Patrick Chala told this newspaper that all passengers aboard the Toyota Hiace rolled-over twice escaped unhurt.
