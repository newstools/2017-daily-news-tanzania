In her brief speech while gracing a gathering to mark the World Social Work Day (WSWD) , the minister said that most of the aggrieved people need protection, which includes counselling, comfort and avoiding unnecessary disclosure of information intended to be confidential.WSWD is held on the 21st of March and this year s theme Promoting Community and Environmental Sustainability relates to the third pillar of the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development. Confidentiality means not only passing on secret details to another person, but counselors need to be quite clear what information is gleaned. Win trust from your clients, Ms Castico said as she emphasised on the importance of counselling in the Islands.She said there have been growing psychological problems, including stress in the society attributed to current lifestyles and that counselling remains the best therapy to people trapped in such difficulties.The minister thanked Zanzibar Social Workers Association (ZASWA) for helping members of the society live comfortably as she promised continued support to the association, which complained that lack of funds and equipment hampers smooth implementation of its activities.Mr Said Suleiman, ZASWA s Chairperson, said despite the financial challenges, the association has been going on well with awareness programmes, mainly offering advice to victims of gender violence, inheritance crisis in families and unemployment. We kindly call for cooperation with government and other stakeholders to help people so that they live happily in the Islands, Mr Suleiman said
