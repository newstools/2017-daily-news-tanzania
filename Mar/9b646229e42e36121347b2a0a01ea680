This was disclosed recently in Dar es Salaam by the Minister for Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Professor Joyce Ndalichako in her speech, read on her behalf by the Assistant Director, (Crosscutting Issues), in the office of the Commissioner of Education in the ministry, Venance Manori.In her speech, the minister reiterated the government s commitment to ensure that the girls are allowed to resume their classes right from Primary schools to the higher institutions where they dropped out. She admitted that their school dropout was still a challenge the authority was addressing including various factors which contribute to that.Mr Venance made the speech while presiding over a workshop on Gender Responsive Education Sector Plan (GRESP), where he said, despite efforts being made by the government to help the girls, some setbacks still exist in many communities including stereotype ideas that it is better to educate a boy than a girl. Other shortcomings in the education system include limited budget allocated in the sector, inadequate gender friendly school facilities, and gender insensitive school management practices. In the list are unfriendly learning environment for girls and people with disabilities, and inadequate trained teachers on gender issues, he pointed out.On his part, Plan International Country Director, Jorgen Haldorsen said their Education 2030 Framework explicitly recognizes the link between education and gender equality outcomes, and called upon the governments and other partner stakeholders to put in place gender- sensitive policies, planning and learning environment for the girls.He said his organisation recently launched its 2017-2022 Global Strategy plan, a five year journey to deliver significant changes for girls and boys, saying that within the framework, they have an ambition to transform the lives of 100 million girls to realise their academic dreams.
