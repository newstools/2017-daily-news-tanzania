The talk has revolved around how professional, the Tanzanian player currently for premier league club Genk in Belgium, is.What I m very happy about these narratives around Samatta is that Tanzanians are finally finding the difference between the Samatta they knew when he was playing for TP Mazembe in the Democratic Republic of Congo and another Samatta, who is presently playing in Europe.In short, they are finally seeing the difference between coaching techniques the Tanzanian player was exposed to in the DRC and what he is presently going through in Europe.The narratives on Samatta are a reflection of their growing understanding on the difference between the DRC s premier league and the European one.In a nutshell, this is exactly what some of us have for quite a while now been writing about, namely, the dire need first to ensure that we took our players through the soccer academy system where they would be exposed to all basic soccer rules, techniques and tactics from tender age.Samatta has and continues to do well in Europe because, one, he went through the soccer academy system, and secondly, he has gone through some of the best coaches in his soccer career.According to some of the narratives on Samatta, there have been comments that the player is very professional, that the two goals he scored were very difficult and could not have been scored by a locally based player.Of course, these narratives are correct, that a locally based player may not have scored through the chances that Samatta had and scored last weekend.Indeed, you cannot score a goal from a very difficult position if you are not schooled in basic football technique, tactics, and that s the difference between Samatta and other locally based players.But there is another equally important point we don t seem to be taking into account whenever we talk about Samatta s performance. And that s, Samatta has been able to cope up with training in DRC and Belgium because the soccer academy he went through had prepared him for such eventuality.Finally, we have come to understand why our clubs have failed, for five solid years, to reach the quarter finals of continental clubs tournaments.Our clubs have failed because the bulk of players in such clubs are not a product of soccer academy system. What this simply means is that most of our players are not schooled in soccer basics.In short, our players are not trainable. For instance, you expose one to a wall pass technique, and he does completely the opposite. You train them on how they should play against their opponents in the first 45 minutes, but after just 15 minutes, they go back to their own, old game.In short, they are incapable of implementing game plans that had been set for them by their coach. In the end, it s not the problem of the coach, but rather the kind of players we have provided the coach with and the sooner we realize the continued existence of this better.This country has had all kinds of coaches including those who played for the English premier league, but our players have failed to respond due to the fact that they were and are short of practical and theoretical knowledge in basic football.Some of the top-flight, world class coaches we have had in the national team include two Germans, Bert Trautman (he died in 2004) and Rudi Gutendorf.Trautman played for the top English Premier League club, Manchester City as goalkeeper soon after the end of the Second World War and Rudi who trained Taifa Stars soccer team and Young Africans was a former Bayern Munich coach.But the two top flight German coaches failed to turn around our teams because of the nature of our players. And if you asked me for my opinion, our players soccer training background made it difficult for them to follow up training.Commenting on Taifa Stars victory, the newly appointed minister whose docket includes sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe, spoke well about the team. He later said, in passing, that he had also been very much impressed by Serengeti Boys qualifications in the continental finals.He said he had also been told that the team had finally made it after 37 years of trials. But those who had the audacity of telling the minister the years the team spent before getting to the continental finals, should have also been courageous enough to tell the minister that the team succeeded because it was a product of well organised, scientifically run soccer academies.The foregoing message is what the minister should now champion as long as he stays in the ministry and especially if he wants to remain relevant.Through Samatta s performance last weekend, Tanzanians are now able to know why it has for years been extremely difficult for their teams to do well in continental and international soccer tournaments.They have not had players who had what it takes to play against the best in the world. And the main reason for that lay in the way we got and prepared our players for local and international soccer tournaments.
