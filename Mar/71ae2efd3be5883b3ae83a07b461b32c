Either, the university will empower more its zonal branches and trim down the number of regional centers all over the country after closing after abandoning plans to establish three centres in Temeke,Ilala and Songwe.Addressing OUT Students Organization leaders in Dodoma yesterday, Vice- Chancellor of the Open University of Tanzania Prof Eliphas Bisanda said, OUT needs to re-organize its internal approach to go with TCU requirements.Prof Bisanda noted that,the government through Tanzania Commission of Universities (TCU) had cancelled out the procedure to join Open University of Tanzania by using Foundation Course procedure, while they chart out the best modalities to enroll such students.The foundation course was basically designed to enable students to attend special academic one-year study at the university to qualify for enrollment for university degree studies. Prof Bisanda also said, instead of Foundation Course, the Open University of Tanzania will come up with another two options for those who didn t possess or complete Advance Level of Secondary studies. They now will be allowed to enroll for a two-year Diploma Course and then proceed for a first degree, he said.However, Prof Bisanda also said the Open University of Tanzania planed to be paper less institution where no hard copies of study materials are used in academic period at OUT. The change will equip the university with the present day technology.The change will also cut down some of operating expenses. Prof Bisanda also said that to enable this plan to function current modality of operating Regional Centers at all over the country will end and then new operating strategy will be based on zones to reduce management expenses and improve quality of education.Prof Bisanda further mentioned seven zones to be established soon to include, Coast Zone which will combine Dar, Coast and Morogoro regions.Others are Central Zone for Dodoma, Singida and Tabora.
