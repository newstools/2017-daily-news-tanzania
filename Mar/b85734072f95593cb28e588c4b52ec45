According to informed experts in the mining sector, all that is required is the formation of a team of experts to analyse the composition of gold concentrate and advice on suitable technological capacity to use in processing the mineral sand. As a matter of fact, the medium-sized plant requires a feedstock of just 50,000 tonnes per annum, which is about the same amount produced by Bulyanhulu Gold Mine alone, Geological Survey of Tanzania Chief Executive Officer Professor Abdulkarim Mruma told the Daily News in a telephone interview yesterday.He said the analysis by the team of experts on the composition of gold ore will be used to develop a smelting flowchart for the mineral processing. The Mining Policy of 2009 stresses on value addition for locally mined minerals and gemstones and this should be the way forward, the GST boss argued.Early this month, President John Magufuli banned the export of the mineral concentrate to mainly China and Japan, for smelting and refining to recover gold.Critics of the domestic smelting however argue that to operate the smelting plant economically, a feedstock of 150,000 tonnes of mineral sand, almost three times the amount produced in Tanzania, are required annually.However, Prof Mruma dismisses the argument as misplaced under the current technological advancement that has allowed manufacturing of smaller plants to process small amount of gold concentrate. Even at our GST laboratory, we have the capacity to conduct an examination on composition of gold concentrate and advice on the technology to use, he elaborated.In a follow-up to President Magufuli s order, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals pushed for value addition to create new jobs, boost revenues and technology transfer, bringing more benefits to the nation.Tanzania Chamber of Commerce and Energy (TCME) Chairman Ali Mpungwe was quoted by a section of the media as remarking: It is not just about the ban on export of copper concentrates the question is whether our copper concentrates production capacity per annum is economically viable. Ambassador Mpungwe argued that at least 500 million US dollars (over 1tri/-) is required to build a mineral ores smelting and processing plant, with the technology mostly available in Japan and Germany.He said at least 150,000 tonnes of copper concentrates must be supplied annually for the smelting plant to be economically viable. Currently, the country produces 60,000 tonnes of copper concentrate per year.Ambassador Mpungwe belittled claims of cheating in mineral sand revenues and subsequent due taxes, saying the process is transparent and every step is subjected to thorough auditing by government experts.A study by Tanzania Minerals Auditing Agency (TMAA) in February 2011 revealed that it was uneconomical to set up the smelting plant at the time but noted with concerns, Other possible by-products from the concentrate (if any) are not declared by the mining companies. The report pointed out that Acacia Mining owned Bulyanhulu Gold Mine (BGZ) and Buzwagi Gold Mines (BZGM) are unique gold mines in the country with their gold and silver found embedded in the ore.
