Pandya from Pandya Rally team is among top Dar es Salaam drivers confirmed to compete in Iringa Rally, the second round of this year s National Rally Championship(NRC) series scheduled to rev off April 22-23 in areas around Iringa municipality.He recalled how he made his career debut in a small Nissan PA 10 car that struggled to beat Imprezas, which were then among the latest models of race cars. Iringa Rally means something to me, I aim going there to prove who I am today ten years later, said Pandya who will be navigated by Awadh Bafadhil in Mitsubishi Evo 9.Pandya said his car was ready for Iringa after undergoing minor repairs and will be fully tested this weekend in areas around Kisarawe. I would like to tell motorsport fraternity and fans in Iringa that I am going there to show maturity and how my driving has been advanced in those ten years.There are seven drivers from Dar es Salaam clubs expected to square it out during the Iringa Rally in the third weekend of April. Also among the top contenders for Iringa Rally title is Randeep Birdi who will be navigated by the national champion, Zubeir Peredina in Mitsubishi Evo 7.Birdi said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that he was going to Iringa to officially start the 2017 season after missing Kobil Rally, the season opener in Moshi last month. It s confirmed we are going to Iringa. Our car is ready and in a good shape to overcome dusty road challenges, he said. But the highest number of entries from Dar es Salaam is likely from Dar es Salaam Motors Sports Club (DMSC) and there are four drivers seeking to win the second round of this year s NRC series.DMSC team will be led by the club s former chairman, Erfaan Aladin, and will also include Arif Haji, Salim Haji and Feisal Nayani. We anticipate Iringa Rally to be one of the most competitive and popular events in the calendar of motorsport in Tanzania, said Aladin who will be navigated by Prabh Bhatt in Mitsubishi Evo 9.The second round of the NRC series will see some of the top contenders fight for top honours, as most of them missed the points in the opening round.Other drivers already confirmed include Ahmed Huwel, Sameer Nahdi Shanto and Davis Mosha, all three making comeback to active rallying staying outside the circuit for over a decade. Mkwawa Pure Drinking Water is the title-sponsor of the two-day rally.
