The company s Executive Director, Mr Alexandre Macedo said the port s fertiliser section is capable of offloading 422,400 tonnes of fertiliser per year. Many farmers need fertilisers, and YARA has been doing everything in its powers to reach them, he said. He added that farmers need education on the importance of using fertilisers so that they can benefit from agriculture practices.He said the company uses 3m/- US dollar annually in various activities that aim at improving agriculture production in the country. He said the company has employed 33 extension officers and has helped the establishment of 1,500 farmers learning centres.In October, last year, the YARA announced between 35 and 40 per cent reduction of fertiliser transportation cost following the launching of railway transport services. Mr Macedo told reporters that inland transport cost has been contributing to the increase of fertiliser prices in various regions. He said transporting fertiliser from factories in Europe to Dar es Salaam port cost only 40 US dollar per tonne, but it cost 100 US dollar to transport the same from Dar es Salaam to Tabora by using road transport.
