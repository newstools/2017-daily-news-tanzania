The directive, among other things, seeks to minimize possible causes of accidents at markets, reduce traffic congestion and curb human activity at all places legally designated as road reserves.Kilimanjaro Regional TANROADS Manager, Engineer Ntije Nkolante said here that people s lives were at great risk from ill-conceived market places, and that it was almost impossible to effect order at such markets. Engineer Nkoante said TANROADS has once again contacted district councils suffering the ill-effects of messy market places to close them for good, noting that his ideas often do not go well with approaches adopted by regional government authorities.The engineer noted that at its last recent meeting, the Road Board, under chairmanship of Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Saidi Meck Sadiki, issued a new instruction to that effect and stern measures would be taken against those who would not adhere to it. Several people have since been injured, some seriously, as they ransact businesses at the unsanctioned market sites.One such incident involved three women who sustained serious injuries when the driver of a Toyota RAV4 hit them at Kiano Market of Masaera Village, Kilema South Ward on January 21st this year. The women were rushed to Kilema Hospital but later transferred to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) for further treatment.When c ontacted for comment, Moshi District Council Executive Director (DED), Ms Butamo Ndalahwa, said her office had already started identifying black markets sitting on road reserves with a view to closing them, saying they would not just close them down but also relocate them elsewhere.The DED also noted that she would have those businesses formalised, and that the district authorities would help the operators earn decent enough incomes to enable them pay taxes to the Government.Ms Ndalahwa is one of new presidential appointees after the 2015 general election. The issue with market sites at road reserves, however, has been discussed and decided to be closed down for about eight years now, but for some reasons no action was taken and the markets continued operating to date.Market infrastructure are supposed to be at least 22.5 metres from the centre of the main roads.Among other things, TANROADS is charged with planning, designing, constructing and maintaining all trunk and regional roads networks -- in cost effective, safe and environmentally sustainable manner the consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy and other Government policies through a competent and well-motivated workforce.
