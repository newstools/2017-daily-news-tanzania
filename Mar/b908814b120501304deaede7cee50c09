He vowed before thousands of electorates in both Unguja and Pemba to have reforms including accountability in public offices, initiate exploration of oil and gas, improve agriculture, infrastructure and attract investors in order to move Zanzibar closer to a middle income country.Dr Shein promised to build a prosperous new Zanzibar with sustainable and inclusive economic growth and to promote unity and peace in the clove-rich islands. Most Zanzibaris who followed the campaign trail, especially supporters of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi -- mainly the youth -- were excited hoping that their lives would be better.Leaders of the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) expressed doubt, saying Dr Shein cannot change Zanzibar as he forced himself into power after unconstitutionally nullifying the 2015 October General Elections and that development partners had sidelined the Islands because of the poll results. CUF Deputy Secretary General (Zanzibar), Nassor Ahmed Mazrui, claimed that Dr Shein would fail in his endeavour to move the country forward economically and socially after the donors cut aid because of the nullification of the 2015 General Elections results.However, one year on in his second term in office, President Shein has succeeded in fulfilling in his pledges to turn Zanzibar into a prosperous nation. Most Zanzibaris are beginning to understand that Dr Shein is on the right track in fulfilling his pledges.A glaring success story is the provision of free education and health services, the increase of government employee basic salary from 150,000/- to 300,000/- per month and the availability of medicines in all hospitals.The president has also won accolades on improvement of infrastructures -- roads, airports and seaports, and plans to purchase another passenger/cargo ship and oil-tanker.During a meeting with journalists last week at the State House to mark his one-year in office, Dr Shein said that he has recorded success in the past year using funds collected from the internal sources of revenue. He said good revenue collection of more than 504bn/- in eleven months has enabled the government to settle a debt of 38.2bn/- owed to 2,739 pensioners.He said Zanzibar s economy is projected to grow by 6.6 per cent while inflation remains at 5.7 percent.He appealed to Zanzibaris to work hard in every sector of human activity to resuscitate the economy. Dr Shein said foreign and local investors such as the Azam Group of Companies have been working on big projects -- housing, first class hotels, recreation centres, roads and light industries which are opportunities for employing the youth.He said construction of nine modern schools is underway with a loan from the World Bank, adding that Japan, China and India have approved millions of dollars for water projects. Other areas of improvement are the public media ZBC-Radio, TV, and the Zanzibar-Leo newspaper.The president said that Zanzibar has been performing well as the economy looks to have a bright future. Dr Shein s first five-year term started in 2010 to 2015 and the second term began in 2016 after fresh general elections.The March 20, 2016, repeat elections were held following the nullification of the 2015 October polls due to massive fraud and irregularities according to the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC). The president won the rerun polls by 91 percent and was sworn-in for his second fiveterm.The main opposition party boycotted the repeat elections. Surely, Zanzibar is on track in achieving its development goals. We have recorded good performance in the past year with improved social services, Dr Shein told journalists. He thanked the public and security agencies for maintaining peace as a prerequisite for development.Incidents of torture by security forces, abuse of the children and women, corruption, theft of farms proudest and livestock and poor performance in schools are some of the challenges that President Shein has to tackle during his second term in office.
