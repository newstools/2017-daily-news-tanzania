Surprisingly, the figure has dropped from 27bn/- after removal of fake names in the compensation pay list, according to the DC which means about 16bn/- had been saved from potentially wrong pockets. He said a special committee which had been investigating the issue discovered massive irregularities under which some cheats filed-in compensation claims with officials entrusted to conduct valuation in the villages around the gold mine.Mr Luoga said owners of more than 1,500 land parcels (pieces of land) are eligible to be compensated after an intensive investigation that subjected every person who was in the initial compensation pay list to stand on his or her piece of land.It soon transpired that the cheats never turned up for the exercise a vigorous verification exercise which took almost a month, according to the report of the committee read by the DC to the villagers.The committee calls for immediate payment to all people entitled to get compensation from the gold mine which is located at Nyamongo area in Tarime District, Mara region. North Mara is one of the largest gold mines operated by Acacia Mining, Tanzanian largest gold producer in the lake zone regions.Speaking at the same occasion, the Acacia Organization Effectiveness and Community Relations Manager at North Mara Gold Mine Site, Mr Saimon Sanga, thanked the villagers for their patient and hailed the work done by the investigative committee.He said mine will go through all the recommendations made by the committee and provide implementation report without delay.The committee calls for further investigation by state agencies like the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) into names of people who involved in the cheating including local leaders and members of the government task force formed to conduct the valuation in the villages around the gold mine a few years ago.
