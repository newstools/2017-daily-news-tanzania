Instead, they want the ban to remain intact to large mining companies conducting mining activities in the country.Speaking at a news conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the smallscale miners said their families were suffering since the president issued an order to ban the exportation of mineral sand exports.Led by their Chairman, Mr Rogers Rweyemamu, the miners claimed that they had suspended operations in their mining pits, a situation that caused unemployment to the people who were employed to work in their business.Earlier this month, Dr Magufuli banned investors from exporting mineral sands, directing the Energy and Mineral Minister, Professor Sospeter Muhongo to fully enforce the sanction. The Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) said on Saturday that it had discovered 262 containers of mineral sand pending exportation against President Magufuli s recent ban on the exportation of such.Yesterday, the small-scale miners came out with a soft move to lobby the Head of State so that he can lift the ban, insisting that they incurred huge losses in their business.Mr Paul Kalyembe said since the president issued a total ban on mineral sand export, his company was incurring an average daily loss of 4m/-. He said the artisanal miners decided to appear before the media because it will be difficult for them to see the president. We really wanted to seek audience with President Magufuli, but we believe if we initiate the procedures to present our problems to him, it will take us many years, he said.Since the president issued the ban, the Acacia Mining, Tanzania s biggest gold producer, was quoted in the media saying that it was incurring an average daily loss of over one million US dollars (over 2bn/-) in revenue at its two mines in Tanzania due to the government s ban on exports of gold and copper concentrate.Acacia said since the ban was enforced on March 3, 2017, it has been compelled to take a range of actions to mitigate the financial impact while ensuring continued safe operations at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi mines.
